<ol>
<li> <strong>Get yourself a customs broker</strong>.
 <ul><li>For example, for European sailors, call [Schenker](http://www.kerrylogistics.com](Kerry Logistics) in the UK or a similar Broker, such as [http://www.schenker.com/index_en/index.html).
 </ul>
<li> <strong>Select a shipper</strong>.  CAST, Mersk, P&O, Schenker, some shipper with a container depot close to where you are.
     <ul>     <li> CAST has a depot in Montreal.  Speak with <strong>Andre Morenci</strong> who has handled competitive sailors and their gear in the past.
     <li> Mersk...
     <li> P&O...
     <li> Schenker...
     </ul>
      <li> Contact that shipper yourself, or have your Broker do it, to <strong>make arrangements for packing the container</strong>.
      <ul> <li> Most sailors pack their own containers to make sure everything is packed properly and securely.
       <li> You can go to the depot to pack the container yourself, which is usually cheaper, or
       <li> You can arrange a truck to bring a container to your Yacht Club to pack, and to take it back to the depot when you are done.
       <ul>
         <li>This is usually easier if you need to coordinate packing several boats belonging to different people.
       </ul>
       <li> Consider building or getting a racking system for the boats within the container.
          <ul><li>You might be able to get a box from your shipper that has built-in racks.
          <li> You could build a simple metal rack system, and screw it into the wood floor of the container.
          <li> removable cross-bars to hold the boats/dollies and masts is always a good idea.
          </ul>
     </ul>

  <li> <strong>Discuss with your Broker</strong> whether you need a [temporary import bond](http://www.uscib.org/index.asp?documentID=1843](Carnet), or if you will just pay a [http://www.shipnorthamerica.com/htmfiles/gloss_cust_tempbond.htm).
    <ul>
      <li> The [Carnet](http://www.uscib.org/index.asp?documentID=1843) is a little more expensive but usually pays for itself in the long run, especially if you are going to be in North America for a while going in and out of Canada and the US.
      <li> <strong>The best thing about a Carnet: You can land in one country, and ship back from another</strong>.
         <ul>
         <li>Example: Land in Montreal or Halifax, and it could leave via a US port.
         <li>Example: come to Canada for training and regattas in July and August, and later sail in Florida midwinters, shipping out from there.
         <li>Plan to load a trailer into the container if you are going to make this kind of trip.
         </ul>
      <li> <strong>The EU is much easier to cross borders</strong>.  <strong>Canada and the US are very distinct entities</strong> in this way.  It's not all just "North America".
      <li> Don't forget paperwork for your coach boat if you are also bringing one of those.
    </ul>

  <li> <strong>Have your Broker do the Carnet and/or temporary import bond</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>This will save enormous time and energy.  Avoid doing this paperwork if at all possible.  It can be annoyingly technical.  If you like a challenge then do this part yourself.
      <li> If you get a Carnet.  Don't lose it.  It is like a passport for your boat.  You can't get it home without it.  Bringing your boat home without a Carnet is like claiming refugee status - very difficult.
    </ul>

  <li><strong>If your container is travelling by ship</strong>, and landing in a Canadian port, there are three options.
     <ul>
       <li> [www.port-montreal.com Port of Montreal][www.port-montreal.comportofmontreal] which is about [300 km driving distance from Kingston](http://tinyurl.com/2b86q3)
       <li> [1500 km driving distance from Kingston](http://www.portofhalifax.ca/](Port of Halifax) East Coast, [http://tinyurl.com/2b86q3), the shortest route being partly through the state of Maine, USA.
       <li> [www.portvancouver.com Port of Vancouver][www.portvancouver.comportofvancouver] West Coast, about 4,000 km driving distance.
       <li> You could ship to a US port. [Boston](http://tinyurl.com/2o6t5m), 690 km away, for example.
     </ul>

  <li> <strong>Decide where to unload your container</strong>.  You can do this at the port, at a more local depot, or at the Yacht Club or sailing venue.
    <ul>
    <li> If you have a trailer anyway, it may make sense to <strong>unload immediately at the port</strong> where the container arrives in Canada.  Sometimes a 200 km truck delivery is the same price as unloading it yourself because of Union rules.
    <li><strong>Container loading and unloading can also be easy by doing it at a depot</strong>.  They have the cranes there, and all loading and unloading happens while the Container is at ground level.
    <li> <strong>If the container comes to Kingston</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You can have your container delivered to [Portsmouth Olympic Harbour][portsmoutholympicharbour].  That's often ideal, teams do it all the time, and it's great if you have lots of gear.  Downsides: container handling is costlier.  You need to hire a crane to take your Container off the truck.
      <li>Another place to send and/or unload containers in Kingston:
  <pre>
  DC Marine Ltd.
  785 Sir John A. MacDonald
  Kingston, Ontario
  Tel. 613-544-5626</pre>
<ul>
<li><s>They have a ramp where a truck can back up, and the container can be be unloaded without taking the container off the truck.</s>
           <li><s>This is especially useful for Coach boats which are too heavy to lift in and out of a container.</s>
           <li><s>Most dinghies can be loaded and unloaded with muscle power.</s>
           <li><s>It is only about 3 minutes drive from [Portsmouth Olympic Harbour][portsmoutholympicharbour].</s>

         </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <li> <strong>Be sure to call 3-4 weeks ahead</strong> to the Club or venue where you will be unloading.  That will make things much smoother.

  <li> <strong>Remember to think about insurance</strong>.
         <ul>
           <li> Container insurance from the carrier is required,
           <li> This usually only covers complete loss of the box.
           <li> If your contents are damaged in transit you are not typically covered.
           <li> Expect difficulty finding an insurance company that will cover the contents for a reasonable price.
         </ul>

<li> <strong>The EU is much easier to cross borders</strong>.  <strong>Canada and the US are very distinct entities</strong>.  "North America" is not like "Europe".  Have your act pulled-together, and in order, if you cross borders here.

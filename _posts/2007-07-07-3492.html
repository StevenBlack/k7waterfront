UP TO THE GILLS -- POLLUTION IN GREAT LAKES FISH</a>  is a 15-page report by Environmental Defence released on July 5th, 2007.

<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li> Toxic chemicals in Great Lakes fish are alarmingly high and becoming more serious over time.
<li> Lake Ontario is the worst of all the Great Lakes.
<li> Toxins that once only surfaced in big fish are making their way down the food chain, to smaller fish.
</ul>

<p>Here's Recommendation 1 (of 8 in total) which is interesting:
<blockquote>
<p>RECOMMENDATION 1: In order to provide a more realistic representation of the state of fish contamination in the Great Lakes and improve fish advisories as an indicator of Great Lakes health, provincial, state and national partners in the U.S. and Canada must develop and maintain a publicly accessible record of information on the current status, evolution and historical levels of chemical contamination of fish in the Great Lakes, including information on the toxicity levels in and around the Great Lakes basin.
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: That's not happening now.

<p><a href="http://www.fishcpaa.com/big_jim_showdown.cfm" target="_blank">THE BIG JIM
SHOWDOWN</a>, this weekend at POH, <strong>rises from the ashes</strong> of the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews092008.html#3864" target="_blank">
WFN Canadian Open</a>  debacle.

<p>This pro/am fishing event will run in support of well-known fisherman, Jim McLaughlin, and his battle with cancer, while also honouring our Canadian Forces.

<p>It starts Friday at the Junior Officer's Mess at CFB Kingston, Saturday and Sunday at POH.

##The Island Grill

<i>The Grill</i> is a friendly and unpretentious bar and restaurant a few steps East of the [[Wolfe Island Ferry]] dock on the [[Wolfe Island]] side.

They have **two outdoor patios** and, or course, **indoor service** too.

At the end of July 2006 there appears to be **six feet of water at the outer dock**, and about five feet at the second finger dock in.

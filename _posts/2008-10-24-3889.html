<p><a href="http://sailing.ca/" target="_blank">A NEW WEBSITE</a>  for the Kingston-based <strong>Canadian Yachting Association</strong>. It's a <strong>huge improvement</strong>.

<p>But there's <strong>no CYA blog</strong>, and <strong>no news syndication</strong> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS format</a>.  In that sense, it's also a disappointment.  <p>Hopefully those relatively easy-gets are coming.

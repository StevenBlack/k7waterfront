<p>THE CITY has posted its <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2011/COU_A0911-11120.pdf" title="Link to the Council PDF" target="_blank">April 2011 Priority Matrix</a>.</p>

<p>It's not a long document but it's one of those PDFs rotated such that you can't easily read it.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/2011CityPriorityMatrix" target="_blank">waterfront
related priorities</a>  found in the document.</p>

<p>In short, 78 items in the list, seven concern waterfront, but <strong>just three</strong> would improve access and two of those are actually being implemented: Lake Ontario Park and Richardson Beach.</p>

<p>The third item, the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/GreatCataraquiRiverTrail" target="_blank">proposed
Cataraqui River Trail Project</a>, is citizen-led and <strong>a long way off</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>VERY slim pickings</strong>.</p>

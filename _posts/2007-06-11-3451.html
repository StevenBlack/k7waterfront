FINALLY BETTER IMAGES OF KINGSTON IN GOOGLE MAPS AND GOOGLE
EARTH!</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">

<p>It's not the closest zoom-level available, but close.  So far it only covers between the airport to the West, CFB Kingston to the East, Marysville to the South, but it goes all the way North to the sourthern-edge of Frontenac Park.

<p>The imagery appears to be from a weekend morning in summer of 2004.

In 1847, during construction of the Martello Tower on Cedar Island - "Cathcart Redoubt", a group of 23 workers were returning home from Cedar Island.  A heavy swell caused the overloaded boat to capsize. Two swam to safety. Another four survived by clinging to the overturned boat. But 17 died. As a result of this, Hamilton Cove, the waters between Cedar Island and Point Henry was renamed ***Deadman's Bay***.<br>
In the years following the War of 1812, a number of British naval vessels were scuttled in Deadman's Bay. The wrecks are still visited by divers.<br>
In the late 1800's, there was a granite quarry on the bay and various barges loaded stone there. Old newspaper accounts indicate that some of the granite was hauled to Ottawa.<br>
Today, Deadman's Bay is the location of the [CFB Kingston Yacht Club][cfbkingstonyachtclub] and [Arrowhead Beach Park][arrowheadbeachpark].

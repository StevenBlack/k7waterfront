<p>This week the City tabled a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/infrastructure/agenda/2006/EIT_A0406-SchedA.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">
transportation report</a>  that suggests, among other things, the re-routing of King Street South of the heating plant to improve flow and alleviate Kingston General Hospital parking issues.  This would require some infilling.  Most of this park exists because of prior infilling.

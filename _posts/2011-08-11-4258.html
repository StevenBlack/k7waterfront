<p>FUNNY, ISN'T IT, that we're never told about actual participation in the 1000 Islands Poker run?</p>

<p>Earlier in August Kingston This Week <a href="http://www.kingstonthisweek.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3244187" target="_blank">
predicted 150 boats</a>  which would have made this year's edition the biggest ever by streets.</p>

<p>About the event itself, The Brockville Recorder &amp; Times reports "<a href="http://www.recorder.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3248097" target="_blank">more
than 60 boats</a>  took part.</p>

<p>As far as we know, local mainstream media had nothing to report after the event.  The Whig Standard didn't run any Poker-Run related story, at least not online, following the event.</p>

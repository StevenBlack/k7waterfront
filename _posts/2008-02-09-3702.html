<p><a href="http://heavens-above.com" target="_blank">SOME BRIGHT SPACE STATION
TRANSITS</a>  are expected over four consecutive evenings around dinnertime on February 12, 13, 14, and 15th.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" target="_blank">station</a>  will appear brighter than usual not just because of its orbital track.  Currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Atlantis" target="_blank">Space
Shuttle Atlantis</a>  is attached, and the station will soon be made slightly larger since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_%28ISS_module%29" target="_blank">Columbus
Science Laboratory</a>  is being added as part of this shuttle mission.

<p>The table above, and the diagrams of the February 12th transit below, come from <a href="http://heavens-above.com" target="_blank">heavens-above.com</a>, (free registration required) which is one of the really great resources on the web.

<p>For viewers in Kingston, the Tuesday February 12th transit will just nick Polaris at 18:51:27.

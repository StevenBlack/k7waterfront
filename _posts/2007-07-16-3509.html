<div style="float: left; width: 360px;"><p><strong>YOUTH WORLDS DAY 3</strong> started looking good for lighter crews but, in the end, Kingston Harbour served-up something for everyone.
<p>The first race on Yellow Course (Cats and 29ers) was set at 240 degrees and later settled in the 200-220 degree range.

<p>The Yellow Course committee still didn't place itself according to plans.  As a result the reach legs are susceptible to nasty blasts, funneled by the Boat Channel South of Simcoe Island (whose axis is oriented about 230 magnetic) and fans-out, mixing with overland air, upon reaching the harbour.

The [[http://issg.org/ Invasive Species Specialist Group]] is a New Zeland-based group that hosts a massive online database of invasive species.

<blockquote>
The Global Invasive Species Database was developed by the IUCN/SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) as part of the global initiative on invasive species led by the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP). It provides global information on invasive alien species to agencies, resource managers, decision-makers, and interested individuals.

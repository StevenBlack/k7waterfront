Dear Friends of Kingston,

As you may remember, the City is trying to divest itself of properties that don't make money. Last year, it identified the J.K. Tett Centre as an unprofitable place and were planning to turf out the tenants -- potters, [[http://www.paulgyoung.com/khws/ weavers]] (also [[http://kingston.cioc.ca/details.asp?RSN=14390&Number=7 here]]), [[http://www.kingstonschoolofdance.com/ dancers]], actors, [[http://www.spaceclick.ca/klmc/ gem collectors]] (also [[http://kingston.cioc.ca/details.asp?RSN=14578&Number=231 here]]). Public pressure prevented the immediate closing and a decision was postponed until February 2006.

Now there are rumours Queen's wants to buy the buildings and surrounding area and build a performance art centre there with money donated by Dr. Bader; the centre to be named after his wife.

The mayor also mentioned in conversation at the Community Foundation birthday party last Sunday that the city might be interested in selling the property for a $1 to a non-profit organization.

A group has now formed to stand up for the Tett Centre and surrounding area, with the goal of preserving this location as a public space and a centre of cultural activity. Very important to me is protecting enough space along the waterfront to allow for the [[waterfront trail]], and, of course, keeping this historic waterfront property in public hands and not letting it be turned into a high-rise condominium apartment complex (always a possibility). Apparently, the Tett building may be the oldest remaining industrial building in Canada -- it was a brewery in the 1840s.

The Friends of the Tett Creativity Centre is trying to build a strong organization to show the deep community support for the artistic work that takes place there, and to make it clear that this space and all it offers is important to our community.

I have attached a <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/FriendsOfTheTettForm1.doc">membership application form</a>. I hope you will seriously consider joining the Friends of the Tett group and lending your support to this group. Adding your voice now may be extremely important -- timing is everything!

Please feel free to pass the application form on to others and encourage them to join, too.

Thank you.

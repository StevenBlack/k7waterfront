<p>On the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2007/PLN_Agenda-1307.pdf" target="_blank">
Agenda of the September 6th Planning Committee meeting</a>  there's a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2007/PLN_A1307-SchedB.pdf" target="_blank">
62-PAGE ZONING BY-LAW AMENDMENT DOCUMENT</a>  for the Admirals Walk project proposed for Cataraqui Bay (AKA Elevator Bay).

<p>There are several issues therein, including parking which appears inadequate for what's proposed.

<p>There's mention of a possible marina, but they apparently don't know which side of the pier, west or east, any future marina will be placed.

<p>One point is crystal clear: there will be no off-season vessel storage on the site -- there simply isn't space -- which means that any marina there risks being a money-loser.

<p>Note that a marina is clearly shown on <a href="http://bobfor.com/kingston-admiral-walk.htm" target="_blank">The Forrest
Group's website</a>  and the yachting theme is central to the project's advertising so far.  All this apparently doesn't add-up.

<p>There are also questions about what the developer can and cannot do with the water lot.

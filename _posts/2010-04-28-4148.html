<p><a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2553718" title="Link to the Whig article" target="_blank">$1.5 BILLION</a>  is allegedly the cost of the proposed offshore wind project, in today's Whig.  It's to be centred on <strong>Pigeon Island</strong>.</p>

<p>The article is actually funny, especially the the parts about KEDCO.  <a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2553718" title="Link to the Whig article" target="_blank">Read the whole thing</a>.</p>

<p>One possible interpretation of the article: arrogant city-slickers chatting-up a hick-town newspaper reporter.</p>

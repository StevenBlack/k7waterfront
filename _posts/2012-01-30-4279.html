<p>SURPRISE! You would think that a winter with negligible snow accumulation would have negative impacts for Lake Ontario Water Levels come springtime.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" title="Link to the US Army Corps of Engineers report on Great Lakes water levels." target="_blank">
LAKE ONTARIO WATER LEVEL FORECAST</a>  predicts higher than normal water levels into the summer.</p>

<p>This makes little sense because <strong>the big lakes upstream</strong> are still well below long-term averages.</p>

<p>Two new topics are now prominently linked on the home page:

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/HighwayTraveler%27sHomePage" target="_blank">THE
HIGHWAY TRAVELLER'S HOME PAGE</a>  seeks to brief Highway 401 travelers, who might otherwise bypass Kingston, about economical and time-efficient options involving Kingston's waterfront.

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Resident%27sHomePage" target="_blank">THE
RESIDENT'S HOME PAGE</a>  seeks to brief most Kingston residents who, on balance, don't participate in their waterfront as much as they could.

<p>Like all topics here, these topics are subject to incremental improvement, so suggestions and contributions are welcome.

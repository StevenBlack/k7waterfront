RICHARDSON BEACH PRELIMINARY PLANS</a>  are posted. So far it's just sketches, no text.

<p>It also appears to be mostly <strong>not</strong> about the beach, but about landscaping above the beach in the form of pathways and lookouts.

<p>What's with the <strong>rock-bounded funnel-shaped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groyne" target="_blank">groin</a>  in the water</strong>?  The rationale for that will be interesting to hear.  Someone should probably ask if the designer has ever been to a beach people actually use for swimming.  Note there's no roped-off swimming area, no swimmers, and no windsurfers shown in any of the drawings.</p>

Mixed reaction</a>  from members of on the <a href="http://kingstonboardsailing.lefora.com/forum/category/news/page1/" target="_blank">
Kingston Boardsailing Association</a>.  Boardsailors are the folks who currently use Richardson Beach the most.  Among other points, the current drawings show drastic cuts to the area they need for rigging and laying-out sailboards.

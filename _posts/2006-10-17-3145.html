LAKE ONTARIO SAFETY ZONES</a>, as proposed by the United States Coast Guard for occasional shooting practice, will have negligible impact on Kingston's boating, diving, fishing, and tourism trade.  Zilch.

<p>American boaters, on the other hand, are <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060928/NEWS01/609280376/-1/archive4" target="_blank">
rightfully pissed at the idea</a>  since it affects them far more than it will ever affect Kingston.

<p>If this goes through, it's just one more reason why the northern shore of Lake Ontario is a nicer place for boating, and for quality of life.  On this so-called "issue" Kingston's current mayor, Harvey Rosen, would be well advised to <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/fish/coast_guard_talks_leave_out_ca.php" target="_blank">
zip it</a>.

Security page</a>.  The box outlined with "blue" dots is the five-mile distance from the U.S. shores and/or U.S.-Canada maritime border. The boxes outlined with "yellow" dots, here shaded pinkish, are the proposed safety zones on Lake Ontario.

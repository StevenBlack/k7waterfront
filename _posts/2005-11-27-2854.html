<p>From the United States Army Corps of Engineers:
<blockquote>
<p>All of the Great Lakes,  except Lake Ontario, are 4 to 6 inches below the levels of a year ago.&amp;nbsp;; Lake  Ontario is 6 inches higher than it was a year ago.... Lakes Erie and Ontario are expected to fall 2 and 3 inches, respectively, over the next 30 days.  Levels over the next few  months on all the Great Lakes, with the exception of Lake Ontario, are  expected to remain lower than 2004/2005. Evaporation rates this fall may  be higher than average due to warmer surface water temperatures. See our <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" target="_blank">
Daily Levels web page</a>  for more water level information.</blockquote>
<p>If this forecast holds then spring 2006 levels look to be about a foot below 2005 levels.

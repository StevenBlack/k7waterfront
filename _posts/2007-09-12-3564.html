<p>ALWAYS WORTHY OF NOTE, especially now that the big breezes of autumn are evidently with us. The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kingstonboardsailing/" target="_blank">Kingston
Boardsailing Association</a>  has a great clickable chart of  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kingstonboardsailing/maps/philspots.htm" target="_blank">
Wave Sailing Spots In the Kingston Harbour</a>  with brief descriptions.
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kingstonboardsailing/maps/philspots.htm" target="_blank">

<p>For example:
<blockquote>
<p><b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kingstonboardsailing/maps/philspots.htm#Snake%20Shoal%20Break" target="_blank">
Snake Shoal Break</a> </b></p>
<p>6-8ft; Straight onshore conditions and nice long rides straight downwind. Jumps on either tack. This shallow shoal is good even in the early season high water. At low water, I wouldn't try to sail straight across this shoal. Instead, ride the surf down either side. </p>

<p>In case you're wondering: <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" target="_blank">
yes, we are in low-water conditions</a>  with levels a full 5-inches below average for this time of year, about 15-inches above chart datum.

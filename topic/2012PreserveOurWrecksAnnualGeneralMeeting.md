<p>It's likely that, if you're not a member, you've benefited from the moorings and other services the Organisation provides for divers.</p>
<p>In this Bicentennial year of the War of 1812, we really hope to gain the support of divers who live in, dive, or simply visit Kingston.</p>
</div>

The **Preserve Our Wrecks AGM** will take place on **Saturday, March 24th** at the Canadian Legion Branch 631 at [http://g.co/maps/smvmu](4045 Bath Road). Breakfast will be served from 9:30 am and the AGM will commence at 11:00 am.

This is a great way to learn about our work and to listen to a talk by celebrated Kingston author and historian [http://www.davidmore.ca/author.html](David More). David More will cover issues relating to the War of 1812 and earlier Anglo-French conflicts.


Members will enjoy the bonus of a $10 deduction from their breakfast costs. You can sign up on the day, or join immediately through [http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?charityID=s25849](Canada Helps).

If you care about the protection and preservation of Kingston's underwater heritage, please consider joining POW, or at least coming along to the AGM.

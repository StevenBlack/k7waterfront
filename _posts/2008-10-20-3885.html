THE 120-FOOT HMS DETROIT REPLICA</a>, which berthed at Confed last week, is the subject of photos submitted by John Duerkop.  The vessel is <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2008/10/hms_detroit_on_its_way_to_newp.html" target="_blank">
on its way to Newport, R.I.</a>.

<p>This replica was the subject of a <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1243727" target="_blank">Whig
aticle last week</a>  about long-ago scuttled plans for a waterfront heritage centre in Kingston.  The Whig re-surfaces the notion of transforming <a href="www.marmuseum.ca" target="_blank">the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes</a>  into a showpiece tourism attraction in <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1254856" target="_blank">this
Monday's editorial</a>.

<p>To be blunt, <strong>it's a silly idea</strong>.

<p>Considering the average Kingstonian has no relationship whatsoever with the waterfront, local-citizen access should come long before the so-called needs of hypothetical "wealthy european tourists".  Kingston needs to become a better place to live, not a better tourist trap.

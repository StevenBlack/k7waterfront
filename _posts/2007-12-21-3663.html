<p>The <a href="http://www.dolphinscubaclub.com/" target="_blank">CFB KINGSTON DOLPHIN
SCUBA CLUB</a>  remains very active with diving throughout the winter.

<p>Yesterday, for example, members <a href="http://dolphinscubaclub.blogspot.com/2007/12/yacht-club-orientation.html" target="_blank">
dove off the Kingston Yacht Club</a>  during the day and then practiced in the <a href="http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/asu_kingston/psp/kmcsc/" target="_blank">KMCSC
pool</a>  in the evening.

<p>The Dolphins regularly post accounts and photos on their <a href="http://dolphinscubaclub.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, and they occasionally update their photo gallery on Flickr which has, among other things, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42413603@N00/sets/72157594546827540/" target="_blank">
a photoset of members ice diving in Kingston Harbour</a>  last February.

<p>Incidentally, though it's a military club, <a href="http://www.dolphinscubaclub.com/info.php" target="_blank">it's membership
is open to all Kingston residents</a>.  A yearly associate membership costs $65.00 for civilians, $45.00 if you're between 14 and 21.

<p>The CFB Kingston Dolphin Scuba Club is one of the truly great things about the Kingston waterfront.  Active year-round, its members always seem to be collaborating with others on the waterfront, and they have been systematically sharing what they do, see, and find.

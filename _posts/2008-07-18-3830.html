<p><strong>BEACH CLOSURES</strong> are the subject of front-page stories in both <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20080718" target="_blank">The Whig</a>  and <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__KTW20080718" target="_blank">Kingston This
Week</a>  today.

<p>Read them both.

<p><strong>Jim Keech, president of Utilities Kingston, must think we're all stupid</strong>.

<p>He certainly knows that Osprey Media reporters are pushovers.

<p>Here we have the City of Kingston bypassing over 7,000 cubic meters of sewage -- <em><strong>over 1.5 million imperial gallons</strong></em> -- into our local waterways <strong>all within the past 10-days</strong> and we're led to believe the <em>e.coli</em> fouling our beaches <strong>must be due to birds</strong>.

<p>It gets worse: they aren't actually metering all the City's sewer bypass points.

<p>And our mainstream media just parrots what these ass-covering municipal suits say.

<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/5000gal.jpg" title="1.5 million gallons is equivalent to 300 of these." style="width:300px;" class="top floatright clearboth" alt="Kingston: a sewage dumping municipality">
<p>For perspective, imagine <strong>300 tanker trucks</strong>, each with <strong>5,000 gallon capacity</strong> exactly like the one pictured here, lined-up taking turns pumping their full contents of sewage into the water.  <strong>That's what 1.5 million gallons looks like</strong>.  The equivalent of that happened this past week in Kingston, by the City of Kingston itself.  And big-cheese Jim Keech says that <em>e.coli</em> has <strong><em>"...nothing to do with sewage"</em></strong> and <strong><em>"...the by-passes that we've had have been relatively insignificant"</em></strong>.

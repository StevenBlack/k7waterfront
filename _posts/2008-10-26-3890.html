NAVY BAY'S EASTERN SHORE</a>  is a half-mile stretch of shoreline that runs from RMC to Point Henry.

<p>It's less than a mile from downtown Kingston.

<p>It's <strong>inaccessible</strong>, <strong>derelict</strong> and, when <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/k7waterfront/sets/72157608074354023/" target="_blank">
explored in mid-October 2008</a>, <strong>trash-strewn</strong>.

<p>Through various levels of government, taxpayers pump millions into Fort Henry each year.  From a waterfront accessibility and recreation perspective, we get nothing back.

<p>Kingston's Waterfront is all the poorer for that.

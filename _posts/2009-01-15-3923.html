LITRES OF SEWAGE</a>  were <strong>dumped into the St-Lawrence River</strong> last Tuesday night during a lengthy power failure.

<p>Nothing's tallied yet on the <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">Utilities
Kingston sewer bypass log</a>.  They call it a log.  It's not a log at all.  It's <strong>minimum-disclosure b.s., Kingston-style</strong>. <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews042008.html#3768" target="_blank">
Here's why</a>.<br>

<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/9500USGal-350.jpg" alt="" class="floatright bottom" title="Kingston dumped enough sewage to completely fill 280 of these tanks into the river this week.">

<p>For a sense of perspective, a very large tank truck, the sort used for wholesale fuel deliveries, can contain 36,000 litres.  Imagine a line of <strong>280 such tanker trucks, a queue over 5-kilometers long</strong>, lined-up to pump their entire contents in sewage into the water at the causeway.   The equivalent of that happened this week in Kingston.

<p>I repeat: <strong>Tuesday the City of Kingston dumped the full contents of 280 of these tanks worth of sewage into the St-Lawrence River</strong>.

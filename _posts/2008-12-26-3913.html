LOCAL CANADIAN CHARTS ON THE OUTS?</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">

<p>That's the scoop according to an <a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/BackIssues/Archive/tabid/393/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/109/Island-Names-Updated-December-2008.aspx" target="_blank">
article</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  by Ross Pollack in the latest Thousand Islands Life.

<p>According to the article:
<blockquote><p>These Canadian charts are beautiful examples of the printers' art: at once highly readable and richly presented with great registration of the different colored inks. But government efficiency will soon eliminate the cross-checking possible with different US and Canadian charts of the same St. Lawrence River waters.</p>

<p><strong>According to a spokesman for the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, navigational charts covering the same US-Canada border areas will no longer be produced by both nations</strong>, and water boundary areas will be divided between the nations for mapping purposes.</p>

<p>The plan is for the relevant stretch of the St. Lawrence River to be charted by the US alone. <strong>Eventually, these Canadian charts, numbers 1435 to 1439, will be obsolete and will be replaced by up-to-date versions of US charts 14770 to 14774 and 14802</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's apparently nothing else online about this yet.  There's something fundamentally repulsive about this.

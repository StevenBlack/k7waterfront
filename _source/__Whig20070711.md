The local public health department has declared Grass Creek Park beach unsafe for swimming because of high E.coli levels.

After conducting 10 water sample tests over the past two weeks, Kingston Frontenac Lennox and Addington Public Health has determined there to be higher than acceptable levels of E. coli organisms in the water.

The beaches at Rotary Park and Lake Ontario Park have also been posted unsafe for swimming recently. Large signs alerting the public of the unsafe water have been posted at all three beaches.

The health department will continue to monitor the E.coli levels in the water and will re-open the beach when they feel it is safe for public use.

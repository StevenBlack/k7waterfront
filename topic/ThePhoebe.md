The Phoebe is a steam launch built in 1914 by the Davis Dry Dock Company in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Her first owners were John and Phoebe Brashear from Pittsburgh USA, who owned a cottage on Lake Muskoka. The Phoebe received Canadian Heritage designation when the late Jack Telgmann, retired engineer from the Kingston Locomotive Works, and Curator of the Pump House Steam Museum, repatriated her from the USA in 1979.

<p>HERE YOU ARE LOOKING southwest from a vantage upstairs at the Radisson Hotel.  <a href="http://aroundshare.com/images/img.php?id=24005" title="Click to see a larger version" target="_blank">Click here</a>  for a much larger version of this photo.

<p>What you see in the middle-distance is the tumble-stone breakwall of Confederation Basin.  In the right-foreground is part of the 250 meters of <strong>new tumble-stone shoreline</strong> around Block-D's <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/TokenPark" title="Link to the K7Waterfront Token Park wiki topic." target="_blank">Token
Park</a>.

<p>In the past this 250m of Block-D perimeter was a corrugated metal seawall where boats could tie-up.  It was a pretty good place for boat-passenger dropoffs and pickups when the marina's docks were packed in the summertime.  It was a fine venue for model-boat racing.  It has been said that many late-summer-night skinny-dips took place there in the hours between closing-time and dawn.

<p>This was, in short, <em>usable shoreline</em> which is in very short supply around here.  But that was then.

<p>Let history show that, in the Harvey Rosen era, the City of Kingston transformed this once-usable protected shoreline into severe inaccessible shoreline. Which begs the question: why?  All this is on calm waters that are amply protected by the massive Confederation Basin breakwall.

<p>This is <em>another</em> waterfront loss in Kingston, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">one
of many</a>  that have recently occurred because of <strong>the raving lunatics</strong> who lead and manage this unfortunate city.

<p>Thanks to Joanna Bull for the photo.

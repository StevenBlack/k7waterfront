The season opening of the Alexander Henry Bed and Breakfast, prized artifact of the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes, will be delayed this year until July.

The retired icebreaker, which is permanently docked outside the museum at 55 Ontario St., won't be accepting guests for the next two months because museum officials hope to move the ship closer to shore.

The B&B normally opens on the long weekend in May.

This year, museum officials say it's necessary to delay the opening so the ship can be moved, to protect it from wind and waves that may push the boat away from an aging dock.

Mark Siemons, chairman of the museum board, said that though the ship isn't in any immediate danger, it makes sense to move it at the earliest available opportunity because of the potential for damage. "It doesn't need to happen this year, but the sooner the better," he said. "We feel it will be more [protected] if we move it where there's more shelter than in its current exposed position.
We're just thinking it would be better if we moved it in.

"It's not a crisis. We're just trying to better manage the property and protect our artifact."

The ship has been docked at its current location since it was moved to the site more than 20 years ago.

"The ship is our most significant artifact and it takes a lot of abuse where it is now," Siemons said. "With Block D development, there are worries that the wind dynamics are changing and it's getting more pressures from wind."

Siemons also said the ship has to be moved when the water level of Lake Ontario is high. So, if the ship is going to be moved this year, it has to happen in June when the water is at its highest level.

Museum officials, he said, are stuck in bureaucratic red tape, awaiting approval from various levels of government.

"You're moving a boat. It shouldn't be as difficult as it is," he said. "This is one of the reasons why the federal government and the City of Kingston have to get this land transfer done for this property because our hands are constantly tied to improve that site. We're caught between two government agencies."

The City of Kingston leases the museum property from the federal Public Works Department for $1 a year and then sublets it to the museum for the same price.

The federal government has deemed the property surplus and wants to either sell it or lease it at market value. For months, the city has been in negotiations with Ottawa to come up with an agreement to extend the lease for five years.

In the meantime, the city is working on the board's behalf to get the vessel moved.

"We've asked for comments on whether they would allow it," said Cynthia Beach, commissioner of sustainability and growth.

Ottawa responded by asking for more information. The city is in the process of compiling that data.

"We also feel there needs to be some structural analysis ... before there are any changes to where the boat is moored," said Beach.

"We want to make sure we're sure that where it's going to be moved is better than where it is right now and we understand that there needs to be some permits in place that the Marine Museum would have to get."

One such permit that may be necessary would have to go through the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, she said.

"The dry dock is a heritage structure," she said. "It's a national historic site and we want to make sure that we comply with whatever the federal government wants us to do ." jpritchett@thewhig.com

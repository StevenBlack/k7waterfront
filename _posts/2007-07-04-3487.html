<p>Now <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20070704Beach" target="_blank">ROTARY
PARK BEACH IS POSTED CLOSED</a>  due to high E. coli levels (again from The Whig Standard, and not the Health Unit website).

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/printableIndividualArticle/9205.php" target="_blank">
Rotary Park Beach was closed in late July, which at the time was
Kingston's first beach closure in 14 years</a>.  That closure forced the nearby Collins Bay Yacht Club to stop in-water instruction until the beach re-opened.

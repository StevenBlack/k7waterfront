##Gordon Island Temporary Closure for Public Safety
Questions & Answers

**Why is Gordon Island being closed?**
The raccoon population on Gordon Island is posing a serious risk to public safety.  The raccoons are displaying aggressive behaviour, climbing aboard docked boats in the middle of the night in search of food and showing a lack of fear even during daylight hours.  Park staff will work with the Ministry of Natural Resources to deal with the problem raccoons during a temporary closure of the island.  Rabies testing will also be done at this time.  Several cases of raccoon rabies have been confirmed on nearby Wellesley Island (New York) since early 2008.

**When will Gordon Island be closed?**
The island will be closed to the public from 1 p.m. on Sunday, July 27, 2008 until 11 a.m. on Friday, August 1, 2008.

**Why are the raccoons a problem?**
The raccoons on Gordon Island have learned to associate humans and boats as a source of food.  This behaviour has developed over several years because the raccoons have been fed by some visitors and have found improperly stored food.  The raccoons have become so habituated to this food source that they are now aggressive and a risk to public safety.

**How will the raccoons be dealt with?**
Park staff will work with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources to trap and humanely euthanize raccoons.

**How often will this be done?**
This is the only closure planned for the 2008 visitor season.  Through public education, the phasing out of garbage collection, and possibly reinforcing garbage collection areas, the park hopes to prevent raccoons from developing aggressive behaviours in the future.

The techniques used for normal rabies testing and vaccination programs should not require closure of the island.

KINGSTON ONTARIO WATERFRONT WEBSITE IS BACK ONLINE</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

<p>Here's the current home page.

<p>Your tax dollars at work; five-figure dollars worth.

<p>Apparently nothing's changed since <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews112007.html#3629" target="_blank">
last November</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  when this first came to light, then immediately taken offline.

<p>It would be interesting to find out: <strong>who is well-served by misleading potential visitors to Kingston?</strong>

<p>Note the adult and two kids, in a what appears to be a 15-foot canoe, mid-Harbour at dusk in imminent weather.  Seriously, how improbable is that?  How wise is that?

<p>International-14 class sailboats haven't actively sailed here for quite some time; all "14" sailboats come here from out-of-town, and they are here maybe one-weekend a year.  The boat pictured here is Toronto-based, shown in no-wind, flat-calm conditions, which is insulting, a bit like picturing a slalom skier in a farmer's field.

<p>Underwater here isn't blue, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42413603@N00/sets/72157603013906543/" style="color:green;" target="_blank">it's green</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  or, if anything, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21982851@N00/tags/kingston/" style="color:darkgreen;" target="_blank">it's dark green</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  There's blue-water diving, but certainly not anywhere near here.

<p>Adding just one more link-button to that web page looks very expensive.  Guess how many files you'd need to touch to add another little box to the left of the canoe.

<p>Is the KEDCO "blue belt" website like <a href="http://business.kingstoncanada.com/communityprofile/index.asp" target="_blank">
other websites KEDCO isn't able to maintain</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> ?


<p>Take a guess: <strong>what percentage of visitors to Kingston ever get their feet wet in Kingston Harbour?</strong>  A single-digit percentage?  One-in-fifty, perhaps?

<p>Take another guess: <strong>what percentage of Kingston residents ever get their feet wet in Kingston Harbour over the course of a typical year?</strong>

<p>Do you suppose it might be because of <strong>fundamental waterfront inaccessibilities</strong> that exist here?  Just who is KEDCO trying to kid?

<p>It's one thing to try and lure visitors here, but it's quite another to be overtly dishonest about what we really have to offer.

<p>The movers behind this "blue belt" website, Ross Cameron, Don Curtis, and KEDCO, are the very same folks who thought <a href="http://kcal.ca" target="_blank">putting the LVEC on waterfront</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">,
expropriating <a href="http://MetalCraftMarine.com" target="_blank">MetalCraft Marine</a>, totally eliminating <a href="http://metalcraftmarine.com/html/marina.html" target="_blank">Kingston
Marina</a>, and comandeering part of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kcal/sets/72157594196437866/" target="_blank">Fluhrer
Park</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  for the LVEC was a fine idea.

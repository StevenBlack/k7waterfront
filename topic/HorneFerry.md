HORNE'S FERRY from Alexandria Point on Wolfe Island to Cape Vincent N.Y. was founded in 1798. Samuel Hinkley took it over by 1809. He was later involved in the Wolfe Island Canal project. The ferry passed to his son-in-law, and then to HIS son in law, Thomas D. Horne (d. 1884) in 1861.  Thomas was succeeded by his son William (d. 1945), and then by his nephews William and Darrell Horne. In 2004 the firm, known as Horne Transportation, was operated by George and Bruce Horne.

The family acquired their first motor boat in 1910.  They owned the ferry Jacques Cartier (35 cars) 1936-37 (then sold her Canadian), and then went back to motor boat ferries and pilot boats.  They ran two former navy landing craft 1945-53 that carried four cars each.  In 1953 they built the current auto ferry William Darrell.

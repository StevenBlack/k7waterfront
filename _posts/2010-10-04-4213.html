<p>The WOLFE ISLAND TRANSPORTATION STUDY is the subject of a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2010/PLN_A1710-10085.pdf" title="Link to the Planning Committee report" target="_blank">City Planning
Committee Report</a>  for its next next meeting on October 7th.</p>

<p>The report is woefully incomplete. For example, the only Exhibit contains this statement which overlays the drawing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alternatives C1-C3 and C5-C17 are also carried forward for further consideration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more on the 16 glossed-over alternatives, see page 14 of the <a href="http://wolfeislandtransportationstudy.ca/pdf/PublicInformationCentre1DisplayPanels.pdf#page=14" title="Link to the PDF of the public meeting display boards" target="_blank">public
meeting display boards</a>  which include a bunch of non-bridge options.</p>

<p>That said, it certainly appears that several evidently ridiculous bridge route options remain on the table.</p>

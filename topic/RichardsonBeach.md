##Richardson Beach

Not really a beach since it's made of limestone shelf-rock. It's located at the foot of Emily Street near the [[Kingston Yacht Club]].

Richardson Beach, also known as "Emily Street", is a favorite location for windsurfers in the Kingston area.  Richardson Beach has parking, changerooms (closed), a grassy rigging area, and very enthusiastic boardsailors.

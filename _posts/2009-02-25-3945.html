<p><strong>Update 3:16 PM: Finally a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/recreation/marinas/Marinas_Development-BizPlanReport.pdf" target="_blank">
readable version of the City Marina Business Plan</a> </strong> (57 pages, 12 Mb PDF) is posted by the web-bozos at the City of Kingston.  It's an incomplete posting, lacking appendices.

<p><strong>Update 7:00 PM:</strong>  Here's <a href="http://K7Waterfront.org/files/Marinas_SustainDevStratBusPlan25feb09.pdf" target="_blank">
the original sloppy version</a>  (164 pages, 7 Mb PDF) first posted by the City.  At least <strong>this one contains the appendices</strong>.  It's just ridiculous how the public gets waxed by the systematic incompetence of the City of Kingston Communications Department.

<p class="quiet"><s>The communications bozos at the City of Kingston have posted a <strong>sloppily-scanned borderline unreadable City Marina report</strong>. </s>

<p class="quiet"><s>I'm trying to obtain a readable version to post.</s>

<p><strong>The report is dated January 5th</strong>. The City Committee meeting is <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/community/agenda/2009/ARC_Agenda-0309.pdf" target="_blank">
tomorrow night</a>. This smells exactly like <strong>the folks we all know running their usual railroad</strong>.

<p>The <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">screwing-up
of Kingston's Waterfront</a>  is apparently continuing unabated.  Early public participation and input in waterfront-related processes is clearly not in the cards, and marinas is no exception.  Quite the opposite, evidently.

<p><strong><a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2885929" title="Link to The Whig Standard letters to the editor" target="_blank">LETTER</a>  AND <a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2885942" title="Link to The Whig Standard article" target="_blank">ARTICLE</a> </strong> in the Saturday Whig about the excessive number of <strong>red flashing tower lights</strong> on Wolfe Island.</p>

<p>The request to tone-down the lighting seems reasonable.  There isn't much, if any, civil aviation in the region, especially at night.</p>

<p>Consider too that mariners have been negotiating the very treacherous approaches to Kingston Harbour with a minimum and decreasing level of lit buoyage for decades now.</p>

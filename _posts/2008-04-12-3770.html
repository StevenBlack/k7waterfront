IDLING BOATS</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  are covered in a proposed by-law to control the idling of vehicles and boats, still in committee at City Hall.
<p>They've received several comments about how boats, with no breaks, need to idle engines to a warm state for safety reasons, since stalling leaves few options.  So <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/infrastructure/agenda/2008/EIT_A0508-SchedA.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">
here's the exemption</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  that addresses that:
<blockquote>
<p> 4.4  Vehicles or boats where idling is required to repair or prepare the vehicle or boat for service</p>
</blockquote>

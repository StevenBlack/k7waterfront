It gives me great pleasure to inform everyone that on September 4th at about 4:00 pm, wastewater was started flowing
through the Biological Aerated Filters**.
This signifies the culmination of a lot of hard work and tremendous effort on the part of the construction team,
the engineering team and Utilities Kingston operations staff.

With the flow through the filters, the process of starting to grow the micro-organisms has begun.
This will take about a month to a month and a half to be fully complete. Once everyone is satisfied that the "bugs" are ready,
we will start the 12 month trial operation, when the process will be put to the test, so to speak, and the performance proven.

I do have to provide a word of caution, however, especially given the strong winds we are experiencing today.
One of the initial effects of the start-up process is the generation of a "foam".
It looks very similar to the suds from the laundry tub or a bubble bath. This is primarily associated with the starting biological growth, and will subside shortly. We are working on controlling this using water sprays. Should those in the vicinity of the plant notice the foam at the plant, please do not be alarmed as we are working to control this.

In the unlikely event that anyone see this blowing off the site, first please ensure that you keep people and animals away from it, as it has been in contact with sewage and may contain harmful bacteria. Any off-site occurrences should be reported immediately to Utilities Kingston Staff Pager at 613-530-4495, who will respond to clean-up the affected area. I have included a broad group of contacts within the City so if you lose this message and call them we will be able to provide timely response.

A big thanks to everyone who has helped us get this far, including our friends and neighbours, and all the partners who continue to push to the finish line for this exciting project. We have come a long way, and this process start-up is key to the project, as is the work still to be completed on the other areas.

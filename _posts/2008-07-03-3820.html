<p>The <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/index.asp" target="_blank">
CITY OF KINGSTON BEACH REPORT</a>  continues to be a <strong>complete screwup</strong>.

<p>Boys and girls, how hard is it to maintain a <em>simple list</em>, as inadequate as that is compared to the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/beach" target="_blank">extensive service lake
swimmers get in Toronto</a> ?

<p>Moreover the City of Kingston's beach report is <em>still</em> linking to a non-existent page at the Health Unit's <em>old</em> website address.

Another summer of ad-hoc Kingston beach reports</a>  from June 23rd.

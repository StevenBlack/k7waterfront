Toronto is focusing on the suburbs in its bid for the 2015 Pan Am Games, aiming to build infrastructure in the city's neglected corners and also further city hall's social agenda by investing heavily in poor neighbourhoods.

While the Exhibition Grounds, Rogers Centre and Nathan Phillips Square would anchor Toronto's contribution to the region-wide bid, a report to be considered by the executive committee next week proposes that all of the city's $50-million spending in building new facilities and renewing old ones would take place far beyond the downtown core.

"It provides an amazing opportunity for those areas that are sort of considered as [playing] a supporting role to the downtown core of the city of Toronto," said Councillor Michael Thompson (Scarborough Centre). "I believe this could serve as a catalyst for really bringing the city of Toronto together. Because we always talk about the need to do that, but we haven't really had the common thread."

Toronto is lending its name recognition to the $1.7-billion bid backed by the provincial and federal governments, but events will be staged across the Golden Horseshoe region, from St. Catharines to Hamilton, to Barrie to Oshawa. A host city will be announced this year.

The University of Toronto's Scarborough campus is being pitched as the site of Toronto's only new venue -- a $170-million aquatics centre and sports complex to which the city would contribute $37-million and retain full or part ownership after the games.

"This development ... is consistent with the city's long-term polls strategy and objectives for investments that will benefit youth in priority neighbourhoods," the report on Toronto's preparations states.

Also in Scarborough, Birchmount Park on the bluffs overlooking Lake Ontario would see the development of a $700,000 new throwing and jumping area for track and field events.

Etobicoke would get $1-million to resurface the track and develop new throwing and jumping facilities at Centennial Park. A $13.7-million facelift of swimming facilities at the Etobicoke Olympium is also proposed. The city would contribute but not bear the full cost of these renovations.

"We have so many good facilities that are in desperate need of renewal," said Councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby (Etobicoke Centre), a member of the executive committee who will vote on the report on Monday.

"The [Etobicoke Olympium] is deteriorating before our eyes, so if we get the Pan Am games, it will be terrific to renew that. And good for the people who had the foresight to build an Olympic-size pool. That's amazing -- especially since it's the only one in Toronto. Good ol' Etobicoke."

Councillor Denzil Min-nan-Wong (Don Valley East), championed a major reinvestment in Toronto's community centres and sports facilities during the capital budget process in December. He said the plan under consideration would go some distance in tackling a multi-billion-dollar repair backlog -- and for once suburban neighbourhoods appear to be top of the list.

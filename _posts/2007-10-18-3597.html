<p><a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/documents/2007-beachreport.pdf" target="_blank">BEACH
REPORT 2007</a>  is a 36-page PDF just released by <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/swim/lake_ontario_waterkeeper_relea.php" target="_blank">
Lake Ontario Waterkeeper</a>.
<p>Seven of the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Beaches" target="_blank">Kingston-area
beaches</a>  are covered in the report:</p>
<ul class="simplebullet">
<li> Richardson Beach (they call it "Murney Tower")
<li> Grass Creek
<li> Rotary Park, (incorrectly identified as part of "Collins Bay Marina")
<li> Lemoine Beach
<li> Arrowhead Beach
<li> Crerar Beach
<li> Everitt Beach
<li> Lake Ontario Park (they call it "Lake Ontario Municipal Beach")
</ul>
<p>Oddly <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/BigSandyBay" target="_blank">Big Sandy
Bay</a>, one of Lake Ontrario's most beautiful beaches, isn't included.</p>

<p>Many of the observations arise from the abject neglect by our municipality for our beaches.

<p>That's not the only beach-related thing that's neglected by the City.

<p>On August 24th we were pleased to report that <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews082007.html#3555" target="_blank">
FINALLY WE HAVE AN ONLINE BEACH REPORT</a>.

<p>But our fears were well-founded: as it turns out, that online beach report is just another web page the City is unable to properly maintain.  There has been no update in the two months since August 24th when the information was first posted.

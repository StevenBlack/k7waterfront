<p>THE CITY has posted its <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2011/COU_A0911-11120.pdf" title="Link to the Council PDF" target="_blank">July 2011 City Priority Matrix</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.</p>

<p>Here's K7's summary of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/2011-07-CityPriorityMatrix" target="_blank">waterfront-related
priorities</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  found in the document.</p>

<p>Of the 86 items in the matrix, <strong>only seven concern waterfront</strong>.
	
<p><strong>Just three</strong> of those would improve access and two of those are actually being implemented: Lake Ontario Park and Richardson Beach. The third item, the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/GreatCataraquiRiverTrail" target="_blank">proposed
Cataraqui River Trail Project</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, is citizen-led and <strong>still a long way off</strong>.</p>


<p>Nothing has changed since the April 2011 Priority matrix except the <strong>Richardson Bath House and landscaping work is complete.</strong></p>

<p>Very disappointing overall.</p>

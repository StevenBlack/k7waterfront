POKER RUN PUBLIC MEETING</a>  to...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...gauge community views regarding the cultural and social impacts of the Poker Run at <strong>6 p.m. on Thursday, April 22, in Memorial Hall, City Hall, 216 Ontario St.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A funny coincidence</strong>: April 22nd is <a href="http://www.earthday.ca/pub/" target="_blank">Earth Day</a>.

<p>Given past <a href="http://kcal.ca/StackedApril24Meeting.html" target="_blank">Downtown
Kingston shenanigans</a>, it will be interesting to see <strong>who chairs the meeting</strong>.

<p>Certainly the meeting location, and meeting start-time, are <strong>ideal</strong> for our <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews042010.html#4127" target="_blank">
self-serving report</a> -publishing Downtown Kingston friends.

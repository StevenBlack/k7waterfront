''ASK offers two learn to sail programs:''
<ul>
<li>The Youth program offers complete integration with the [[http://kingstonyachtclub.com/lts/js.cfm KYC Junior Sailing program]]. The sessions mirror the Junior Sailing 2 week session but are flexible to meet the needs of the sailor.
<li>The Adult program provides supervised or instructional courses offered starting each June 5th. Course times are flexible and can be personalized to fit your schedule.
</ul>

Able Sail Kingston uses a fleet of [[http://www.accessdinghy.org/equipment/boats/303wide.htm Access 303]] and [[http://martin16.com/ Martin 16]] sailboats.

See, for example, [[http://kingstonyachtclub.com/ablesail/cork2006/index.cfm Able Sail at CORK 2006]] including [[http://cork.org/results2006/M16.HTM Martin 16 CORK results]].

In summer 2006 Able Sail Kingston had a dozen adult sailors in the program, several of whom came out a weekly basis. [[http://www.ontariosailing.ca/Programs/Accessible_Sailing/Audrey_Kobayashi.php Audrey Kobayashi]], program director, is the Ontario Champion for disabled sailing, winning every regatta she entered, including [[http://cork.org/results2006/M16.HTM CORK]] and [[http://www.martin16class.org/events/coupequebec.php Coupe du Quebec]]. Several other sailors competed for the first time this year and placed very well.

The program is open to anyone with a disability. We have sailors whose disability ranges from spinal injuries, to MS. It is committed to getting anyone into the boats, no matter their disability.

''ASK boats can be steered''
* manually,
* with an electronic joystick used for sheering,
* with a windlass system to operate the main and jib sheets,
* and a sip and puff system for those who have disabilities which limit their mobility.

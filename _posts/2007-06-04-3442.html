<p><a href="http://www.wolfeislandwind.com/draft_EA_report.htm" target="_blank">THE
DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT</a>  for the Wolfe Island Wind Project is now online.

<p>It looks like the cable will land in Sand Bay on the Kingston side, and <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/PatersonPark-WolfeIslandWindProjectCable" target="_blank">
won't be going through Paterson Park Shoal as many had feared</a>.

<p>Paterson Park Shoal is one of our <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kingstonboardsailing/mainx.htm" target="_blank">prime
windsurfing wave sailing spots</a>.

##Waterfront Items on the City of Kingston Priority Status Matrix July 2011
Posted for the [http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2011/COU_Agenda-1611.pdf](July 19 2011 Council Meeting), this [http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2011/COU_A1611-11206.pdf](86-item priority matrix)

**Summary:** 7 of 86 items concern waterfront and, of those, just three (Richardson Beach, Cataraqui River Trail, and Lake Ontario Park) involve access and recreation.  One of the seven items, the Tett Centre, is likely to be a significant [http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews092010.html#4208](accessibility downgrade) -- see also [http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews032009.html#3958](here) -- despite early noise otherwise.

Since the April 2011 version of this, the only waterfront change is the Richardson Bath House and landscaping work is complete.

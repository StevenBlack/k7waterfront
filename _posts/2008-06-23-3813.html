<p><a href="http://kflapublichealth.ca/Default.aspx" target="_blank">ANOTHER SUMMER OF
AD-HOC KINGSTON BEACH REPORTS</a>, it seems.

<p><a href="http://kflapublichealth.ca/Default.aspx" target="_blank">The Health
Unit</a>  Communications Officer, Mr Justin Chenier, has made it very clear: there are currently <strong>no plans</strong> for a link, nevermind a dedicated page, about local beaches on the Health Unit website. Don't even think about it; it's not on the radar.

<p>If you need the latest on local beaches, <strong>you'll need to root through the Health Unit's news dispatches</strong>, essentially fending for yourself, interpreting the fragmentary disclosures therein.  Assuming you find it at all.

<p>Also, this Health Unit declares beaches unsafe, but <strong>does not explicitly declare them safe again</strong>.  So faced with, say, a 5-day old beach report, what should one conclude?

<p>Alternately, you could consult this <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/index.asp" target="_blank">
City of Kingston web page</a>  (found via "Residents", then "Environment", not "Recreation") which provides a list, but with no date-of-update and no other cues, so <strong>information freshness is always in doubt here</strong>.  This same page showed Lake Ontario Park Beach and Rotary Park Beach closed for most of the winter, a sign that keeping this list fresh certainly wasn't any sort of priority last year.

<p>The City web page currently <strong>links to the Health Unit's old website address</strong> (<a href="http://www.healthunit.on.ca/programs/environ.html" target="_blank">http://www.healthunit.on.ca/programs/environ.html</a> ) which, like all references to the old website, redirects to the current home page where, assuming the beach news hasn't scrolled-off, <strong>you might find more beach-related information</strong> in the 4-item news-area found there.

<p>This is all very sloppy.  There's no possible excuse for this.

<p><strong>Now look at Toronto</strong>: they do it better.  Toronto has:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.toronto.ca/beach/" target="_blank">several dedicated pages
about its beaches</a>,
<li><a href="http://www.toronto.ca/beach/2008conditions/ecolilevels_20080620.htm" target="_blank">
detailed recent, and not-so-recent, quantitative data on specific
sampling results</a>,
<li><a href="http://www.toronto.ca/beach/signs.htm" target="_blank">the location of
beach warning signs</a>  so you'll know where to look,
<li><a href="http://www.toronto.ca/beach/swimmingconditions/index.htm" target="_blank">a
daily beach overview of the region</a>  including a general interactive map leading to beach-specific maps, and
<li><strong>a hotline anyone can call</strong>, (416-392-7161), to hear a recording of the very latest water quality conditions.
</ul>

<p>Here in Kingston, <strong>don't even think of making suggestions for the Health Unit website</strong>: they are evidently only interested in <strong>hearing themselves tell you</strong> how great the KFL&amp;A Health Unit website is.  You'll be talking with God's gift to local beach users.  That's got to change.

<p>All this is emblematic of how much our municipal and local bureaucracies, at every level, need <strong>a swift kick-in-the-butt</strong> when it comes to respecting our waterfront and its users.

snooze, you lose -- Kingston's disappearing waterfront</a>.  This beach-report situation is more evidence that some nine-to-fivers among us are evidently auto-stumbling through their waterfront-related dossiers.

<p>CNN reports <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/06/15/annoying.algae.ap/index.html" target="_blank">
Green goo globs up Great Lakes</a>.  It appears that algae blooms have been on the rise since the mid-1990s in parts of all of the Great Lakes.  Here's the <a href="http://www.mecprotects.org/pr06_13_06.htm" target="_blank">text of the

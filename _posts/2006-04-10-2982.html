<p>Lake Ontario Waterkeeper reports that <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/swim/kingston_dumps_46million_litre.php" target="_blank">
Kingston dumps raw sewage... again... and again... and again...
and again... and again</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.
<p>Kingston has bypassed sewage seven times during five "events" in the first quarter of 2006.  According to Waterkeeper, since 1999, the city has dumped well over 1-<b>b i l l i o n</b> litres of raw sewage into area waterways.  How embarassing.

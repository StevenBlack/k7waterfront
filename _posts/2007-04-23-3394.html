<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Halifax_(FFH_330)" target="_blank">THE
FRIGATE HMCS HALIFAX</a>  will be paying a call to Kingston this week as part of its <a href="http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/halifax/news/ship_news_e.asp?x=1&amp;id=745" target="_blank">
Great Lakes Tour</a>.  She's expected Wednesday April 25th, departing Thursday.

<p>While in Kingston, <strong>visits of the frigate are by invitation only</strong>, whereas all the other ports of call are open to all visitors. This is no doubt because, unlike the other ports of call, Kingston doesn't have an adequate dock for her.

<p>HMCS Halifax is 442ft 10in (134.2 m) long overall, and draws 15ft 4in (4.9 m), and she carries 234 officers and crew.

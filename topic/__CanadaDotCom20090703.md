##Film shows peril to Great Lakes
By Jay Stone, Canwest News ServiceJuly 3, 2009


The good news in Waterlife, a documentary about what's happening to the Great Lakes (in a word: disaster) is that there is still wondrous beauty, sparkling vistas, and even the occasional fish, although you may not want to eat it. The bad news is everything else.

Waterlife was made by Kevin McMahon, a documentary filmmaker who once worked as a newspaper reporter covering the Love Canal scandal, which is part of the bigger story: the largest supply of fresh water in the world, five lakes that supply drinking water to 35 million people, is a soup of chemicals, waste, invasive zebra mussels, fish-killing lamprey, bizarre Asian carp and a pharmacopoeia of drugs, including anti-depressants. You may need them.

McMahon traces water from the head of Lake Superior down through the lakes to the mouth of the St. Lawrence where, we're told at the beginning of the film, the beluga whale might be the most contaminated marine mammals on the planet: a quarter of the males are dying of cancer.

Why? The answers lie on the shores of Superior (paper plants); Michigan (Chicago dumps its waste into its river, then installed a system to shuttle what narrator Gord Downie calls "the city's poop" down the Mississippi; coming the other way are Asian carp, aggressive fish that leap right out of the water at you); Huron, where zebra mussels in one year took over the entire ecosystem; "sad old Lake Erie," where estrogen in the water is turning male frogs into female frogs and where one town has two girls being born for every boy; a brief side trip to Lake St. Claire, where we meet a man whose lakeside house is now a weed-side house thanks to dropping water levels; and on to Ontario, into which water pours over Niagara Falls and past the Love Canal, where there are at least 200 toxic waste sites where industry dumped its deadly effluent.

Waterlife -- which won a special jury prize at this year's Hot Docs festival -  is disturbing enough and there aren't many signs of optimism. It opens in Vancouver July 17.

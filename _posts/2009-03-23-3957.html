truly bizarre August 2006 inception</a>  as a <strong>suspiciously narrowly-circulated RFI</strong>.

<p>(Hey, you have to agree: it's <strong>a great way to run a railroad</strong>.)

<p><strong>FINALLY</strong>, for perhaps the first time in <strong>the seemingly endless Harvey Rosen era</strong>, Kingston waterfront takes a step that's <strong>NOT</strong> <a title="The original LVEC on Anglin Bay proposal." href="http://kcal.ca/kcalrss022005.html#2653" target="_blank">downright stupid</a>, or <a title="Minuscule shoreline touted as major waterfront" href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews082007.html#3557" target="_blank">

<p><strong>THAT</strong> the recommendation for the relocation of the Coast Guard at Portsmouth Olympic Harbour be exempted from
the above clauses, and that it be referred back to staff for review and reconsideration in light of the community
concerns raised within correspondence and through a delegation to the Committee on behalf of the Portsmouth
Villagers Community Association.

IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  on Kingston's waterfront late last week.  <a href="http://metalcraftmarine.com" target="_blank">MetalCraft Marine</a> rolled-out the hull of their largest fireboat ever.

<p>The purpose of this was to mate it with its superstructure.  Hulls are built upside-down so rotating the hull was part of the process.

<p>This fireboat is destined for service in Tampa, Florida.  Thanks to John Duerkop for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/k7waterfront/sets/72157607924816495/" target="_blank">

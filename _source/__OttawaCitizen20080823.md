##Rideau Lakes miss the boat###Area has everything except a visible attempt to promote itself

As a tourism area, Ontario's Rideau Lakes has everything. Everything, curiously, except a first-rate tourism industry.

This area between Smiths Falls and Kingston has lakes of all sizes, the Rideau Canal, the Cataraqui Trail, fine fishing, decent golf courses, excellent scenery and some quaint towns. What it doesn't have is any visible effort to promote or package all that attractive stuff.

It also lacks any major tourist resorts. It doesn't even have middling-sized resorts. Many of the tourist accommodations are ancient without being interestingly so. On the one hand, this has kept the area charmingly real, but it's also an example of how this part of Ontario is missing the boat on tourism.

One sees quite a few U.S. licence plates at this time of year, but a lot of them belong to Americans who own cottages in the area.

Any successful tourism industry offers lots of ways to separate tourists from their money, but they are sadly lacking in the Rideau Lakes area. There isn't anything that one would call a major attraction, per se. Westport has some interesting shops and seems to be the one community in the region that knows how to draw tourists. There are some adequate restaurants, although none that I would call good or interesting. Despite the abundance of water and scenery, most of the restaurants offer views of neither.

Hotels are rare. Bed-and-breakfast establishments are uncommon, despite a wealth of interesting old houses that would be perfect for that kind of business.

The area doesn't even have a tourism association. The Westport and Rideau Lakes Chamber of Commerce has some interest in tourism, but not much information on its website.

I've been camping in the Rideau Lakes area for nearly 20 years, and I am surprised at how little the tourism industry has advanced.

When I say that the Rideau Lakes is missing the boat, it's quite literally true. There's a great business to be had in taking tourists down the Rideau Canal through these picturesque lakes, stopping at points of interest along the way. The potential points of interest would have to add a little oomph to make it work, but it's a feasible idea. How can this area have a UNESCO World Heritage Site running right through it, and make so little of it?

To put the Rideau Lakes situation in a larger context, the Canadian tourism industry needs to do much more to attract U.S. tourists concerned about high gas prices and bored with stale attractions. The Rideau Lakes also forms a natural gateway to Ottawa. A better Rideau Lakes tourism industry would benefit that city, too.

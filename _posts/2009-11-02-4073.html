<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2009/A21_Rpt110.pdf" title="Link to the Council agenda document" target="_blank">TWO WATERFRONT
ITEMS</a>  on Tuesday's Council agenda.
<ul>
<li>The city wants to renew a 5-year lease with The Crown for POH land and land underwater. The rental rate is ''20% of the marina's annual gross revenue'', or a payment of $75,848 in 2008.
<li> Kingston &amp; the lslands Boat Lines Ltd. will keep the <em>Island Queen</em>, <em>Island Belle</em>, and <em>Island Star</em> at POH this winter on account of the Lasalle Causeway lift-bridge being <strong>out-of-commission for repairs</strong> for the next several months.  </ul>
<p>It looks like a <strong>sweetheart deal</strong> for KBL.  The city is applying the same linear-footage charge they use for non-commerical pleasure boats one-tenth the length of these vessels.

<p><strong>Winter storage fees ought to be a function of area occupied</strong>, not just nominal length.
<p>KBL will be storing its <strong>three</strong> large wedding-cake vessels for about five-months, through April 30th, for the grand-total of, get this,  <strong>$4,784</strong> plus hydro for the bubblers.</p>

<p>The normal folks paying over $600 in POH winter storage fees for their relatively tiny 30x10-foot sailboats can read that again.

<p>When it comes to selling waterfront short, when is the City of Kingston <em>not</em> a pushover?

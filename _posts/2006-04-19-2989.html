<p>Cold water and its effects are involved in virtually all kayaking and recreational boating deaths.  An <a href="http://www.yachting-world.com/auto/newsdesk/20060313132245ywnews.html" target="_blank">
article posted on the Yachting World website</a>  explains what makes cold water exposure so potentially risky, reviews some strategies to minimize that risk, and raise a few hairs with some stories of tragic, and mostly preventable, cold water deaths.   For example:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li> Nine elite marines, water survival instructors, capsized in 36F water wearing sweatsuits and no PFDs. None of them survived the attempted 100 yard swim to shore.<br>
<li> Sixteen (16) Danish fishermen jumped into the icy waters of the North Sea when their trawler sank in a storm. They were in the water for a 2 - 3 hours before being rescued. They walked across the deck of the rescue vessel and went down into the galley to warm up. Each and every one collapsed and died in the galley.<br>
<li> An average adult person has a 50/50 chance of surviving a 50 yard swim in 50F. water.<br>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/WaterTemperatures" target="_blank">current
water temperature</a>  in these parts is 40F.

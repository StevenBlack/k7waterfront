<p>CORK BLOGGING: Here are links to competitors, volunteers, and spectators blogging about CORK.  This beats the Kingston Whig Standard, which has had almost zero coverage so far, and the  <a href="http://cork.org/" target="_blank">CORK website</a>, which has a "News" link with no recent news to be found there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrew Campbell</strong>, who recently won a gold medal for the USA in the Laser class at the Pan-Am Games: <a href="http://campbellsailing.com/index.php/2007/08/15/monday-morning-tactician-13-august-2007/" target="_blank">
Monday Morning Tactician: 13 August 2007</a>  about the importance of long-view weather checking before a competition like CORK.
<li><strong>John Pearce</strong>, a US Olympic sailing hopeful (he placed 4th at US Laser Nationals), posted an item titled <a href="http://pearcesailing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Training Camp in
Kingston</a>  on Wednesday.

<li><strong>Jenny</strong>, a CORK volunteer, posted an item titled <a href="http://jenmoscrop.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!EB842F0568F56DC8!217.entry" target="_blank">
CORK Sailing</a>  yesterday.   It sounds like Jenny would love to do more actual sailing.  Reading downward, she also volunteered for the <a href="http://www.ktowntri.com/" target="_blank">Kingston Triathlon</a>.  Jenny's evidently a giver.

<li><strong>Monika's Adventures</strong> has an August 11th post titled <a href="http://www.ohrsa.ca/monikasadventures/?p=24" target="_blank">CORK,
Canadian Olympic Regatta Kingston</a>.  Monica also had a recent post titled <a href="http://www.ohrsa.ca/monikasadventures/?p=22" target="_blank">International
Sailing in Kingston</a>  about volunteering for the ISAF Youth World Championships in July.

</ul>
Volunteers are so important to Kingston's many waterfront events...

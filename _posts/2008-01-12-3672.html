<p>STILL IN PLANNING: This is not new, but a reminder about three waterside 100-meter wind turbines being proposed for the Invista property at 455 Front Road.  This item appears on the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2008/PLN_Agenda-0308.pdf" target="_blank">
agenda for the next City of Kingston Planning Committee
meeting.</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">

<p>It seems surprising that, in the context of the large Invista plant and the location of the turbines, that a noise report would be required here.

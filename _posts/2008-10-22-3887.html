THE LIVING AT THE BARRICADES PODCAST</a>  from October 16, 2008 titled <em>Landfills, Leachate and Law</em> is very interesting because it contains a lengthy segment on the Belle Park leaching landfill case, which the City of Kingston fought for eight years <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/press/release.asp?mode=show&amp;id=1366" target="_blank">
all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada</a>.

<p>That was <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Disgraces" target="_blank">embarassing</a>  for the City of Kingston.  Harvey Rosen was Mayor of Kingston through most of the the appeals.

<p>The segment following Kingston's is about the City of Hamilton which pled guilty to similar charges at the first opportunity, wasting no time towards fixing the problem.

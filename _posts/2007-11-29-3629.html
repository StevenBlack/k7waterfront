<p><a href="http://dev.kingstonontariowaterfront.ca/index.cfm" target="_blank">KEDCO'S
KINGSTON ONTARIO WATERFRONT WEBSITE IS EVOLVING</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

<p>Here's the current home page.

<p>Note the adult and two kids, in a what appears to be a 15-foot canoe, mid-Harbour at dusk in imminent weather.  Seriously, how improbable is that?  How wise is that?

<p>International-14 class sailboats haven't actively sailed here for quite some time.  The boat pictured here is Toronto-based, shown in no-wind, flat calm  conditions.

<p>Underwater here isn't blue, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42413603@N00/sets/72157603013906543/" style="color:green;" target="_blank">it's green</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  or, if anything, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21982851@N00/tags/kingston/" style="color:darkgreen;" target="_blank">it's dark green</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

<p>Adding just one more link-button to that web page looks very expensive.  Guess how many files you'd need to touch to add another little box to the left of the canoe.

<p>Is the KEDCO "blue belt" website like <a href="http://business.kingstoncanada.com/communityprofile/index.asp" target="_blank">
another website KEDCO isn't able to maintain</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> ?

<p><strong>Update Saturday Dec 1st:</strong> Inter Kingston Web Design has taken the website offline. Evidently the "blue-belt" website project, as currently conceived, has some serious content, presentation, and governance issues.

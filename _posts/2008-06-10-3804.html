<p>In the Whig today, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20080610" target="_blank">this
story</a>  about a move by the Kingston Historical Society to rename <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Parks" target="_blank">Breakwater Park</a>  after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bradstreet" target="_blank">Lt.-Col.
John Bradstreet</a>, the British officer who led <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Frontenac" target="_blank">the
battle to overthrow Fort Frontenac</a>  250-years ago this August.

<p>The French among us may not be amused by this idea.  John Bradstreet had 3,000 men at his disposal against 110 French soldiers garrisoned inside the Fort.

<p>Maybe this park could be renamed <em>in perpetuity</em> after present-day narcissists for the equivalent of one-sixth the cost of a single renovation.  Like <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/press/release.asp?mode=show&amp;id=2327" target="_blank">
what's happened to Market Square</a>.   Here's <a href="http://kingstontaxpayersassociation.ca/MarketSquareRenaming.htm" target="_blank">
a reminder how that went down</a>.  For history's sake.

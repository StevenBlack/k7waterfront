<p><a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/" target="_blank">THE FEBRUARY 2008
EDITION OF THOUSAND ISLANDS LIFE</a>  is online with, as usual, some stunning photographs.

<p>Notable articles this month include <a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/" target="_blank">Ghosts of Fort
Henry</a>,  <a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/PiscesEel12608header.htm" target="_blank">Elusive
Eels</a>, and <a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/IslandNames2.html" target="_blank">Island
Names</a>.

<p>Looking back in the archive we see in January:  	<a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/SinkingScubaAttraction2.htm" target="_blank">
Sinking a Scuba Mecca</a>  about HMCS Terra Nova,  <a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/ABMG.htm" target="_blank">New Gananoque
Boat Museum</a>  which is on hold, and <a href="http://www.thousandislandslife.com/LowWater3.htm" target="_blank">Low

<p>Excellent.

<p>It turns out that the City won't be forced to abide by <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/lok/index.cfm?DSP=content&amp;ContentID=7457" target="_blank">
these proposed rules</a>  (see also <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/lok/documents/EBRreviewKingstonSTP.pdf" target="_blank">
here</a> ).
<p>In short, the City won't have to do this:
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Notify downstream communities prior to bypassing sewage into waterways.
<li>Monitor every bypass and publicize the length of the bypass, the quantity of sewage discharged, the direction and size of the plume, the level of contamination present in the bypass (eg, E. coli concentrations), and other similar data.
<li>Ensure that every waterway is cleaned up after being exposed to a bypass.
</ol>
</blockquote>
Instead, the City and the Ministry of the Environment negotiated a non-binding "letter of commitment" to notify the medical officer of health and the Frontenac Islands Township in the event that untreated waste is discharged into area water.

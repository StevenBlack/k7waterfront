<name>Confederation Basin breakwall is inaccessible</name>
<description><![CDATA[
  The waterfront breakwall that surrounds Confederation Basin could have been a marvelous pedestrian jetty. It isn't.  It's for birds only.

<description><![CDATA[
  No fuel, no pumpout.  The closest grocery store, and the closest liquor store, are 650m away, and the closest beer store is 1.3 km away.  Also: no anchoring in the basin.

<description><![CDATA[
  This is the sensor that reports what you read in public weather forecasts.  Fairly accurate in all directions, though the Kingston Airport isn't as prone to the sea breezes found in Kingston Harbour. BEWARE: This sensor is offline between 11 pm and 7 am.

<description><![CDATA[
  Not really a marina.  This is a dock where you can park for a short period (make sure you let the bartender know) to explore around Marysville for a while.  It's a shame more boats don't use this facility. The fact is there is nothing about this dock that's welcoming.

NOT MAKING THIS UP</a> : Read the caption below this photo which appeared on page 60 of the Saturday Kingston Whig Standard, <i>The Ticket</i> section, in a travel article about sailing in Spain.

<p>"A Chinese team and the U.S. BMW Oracle <i>narrowly miss capsizing</i> off the coast of Valencia, Spain"

<p>Can you imagine this caption on that photo appearing in a daily paper based in Annapolis MD, La Rochelle France, Sardinia Italy, or Sydney Australia?

<p>One possible lesson:

<p><strong>Do not underestimate the massive amount of education required about waterfront and waterfront activities (like sailing) in this town</strong>.

<p>Normal intelligent people can still be almost totally clueless about waterfront in general, and sailing in particular.

<p>If you are reading this and you don't sail, then maybe it's not obvious.  What we see in the photo are two normal America's Cup boats crossing as they sail upwind in light to medium breeze.  They are nowhere near capsizing.

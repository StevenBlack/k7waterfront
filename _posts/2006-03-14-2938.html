<p>From the <a href="http://www.great-lakes.org/wklyfish_nz.html#Weekly_Great_Lakes_Water_Levels_for_March_10,_2006" target="_blank">
United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> :
<blockquote>
All of the Great Lakes are 3 to 8 inches below the levels of a year ago.  Lake Superior is below chart datum and is expected to be at the same level a month from now.  Lake Michigan-Huron is below chart datum and should rise 4 inches within the next 30 days.  Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie are expected to rise 4 inches over the next month and Lake Ontario is expected to rise two inches over the next month.  Due to a warmer than average January and February some of the Great Lakes seem to have begun their seasonal rise earlier than normal, but levels over the next few months on all the Great Lakes are expected to remain lower than 2005. </blockquote>

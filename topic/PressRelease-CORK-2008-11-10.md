##New for the 2009 August CORK Events
<div class="column2">

Kingston hosts the annual <a href="http://cork.org">CORK</a> regattas and a number of other major events, including the 2007 VOLVO Youth Sailing ISAF World Championship. We are committed to deliver excellence in regatta management, encouraging the development of youth and elite athletes, volunteers and officials.

''To better focus the events'', the August CORK event format has been modified to include three major events, each with their own focus;

###August 19 - 22, 2009: CORK International Event

This event will focus Youth and Development classes, providing learning opportunities as well as excellent racing. Ontario Sailing is a partner in organizing the coaching aspect of the event.

###August 23 - 27, 2009: CORK Olympic Classes Event (OCR)

This event includes Olympic and invited development classes, focusing on high performance competition. ISAF grading - The only two annual Grade 1 events in North America are Miami OCR and CORK Regatta for Laser and Radial. The Annual ISAF Ranking is important for Canadian sailors as it is used as a base to award participation spots at the ISAF Worlds.

###August 28 - 30, 2009: Offshore and One Design Keelboat and Dinghy Classes

This includes the traditional Offshore (PHRF) event, one design Keelboats, Able Sail and international dinghy classes. This event will feature enhanced social package. -- The Blues Festival is on in Kingston at the same time and will provide excellent opportunities to enjoy the Kingston night life.

The CORK events include ''events for all ages and experience levels''. The new format will provide  appropriate challenges for the diverse fleets we have in each event. The change will enable us to better align each event with the skill level and focus of the participants. Based on feedback from the Sailing Community, volunteers and partners, the Board of CORK/Sail Kingston has decided to modify the competition format as described.

The three events combine to include all ages and experience levels, providing skill appropriate events for developing athletes and elite athletes as well as the lifelong sailor.

The CORK Fall event in September will continue to be an elite event, providing a high level competition in the fall to round out the Canadian competitive season and to provide yet another opportunity for these athletes to participate in a highly competitive event in Canada.

Our aim is to stay participant focused with a goal to deliver excellent regatta management and sport development opportunities in support of the long term athlete development model.

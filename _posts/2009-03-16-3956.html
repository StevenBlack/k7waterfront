LAKE ONTARIO SPRING WATER LEVELS</a>  are looking good after a winter with lots of precipitation in the Great Lakes Basin.</p>

<p>That's good because <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews112008.html#3905" target="_blank">
last November's forecast</a>  was bleak.  The latest forecasts are a full-foot above that.

<p>If water levels matter to you, don't miss the <a href="http://www.islrbc.org/new-Version/transcripts/Public%20Meetings/Announcement-090317.pdf" target="_blank">
International St. Lawrence River Board of Control public
teleconference</a>  tomorrow (Tuesday) between 7:00-8:30 pm.

TOKEN PARK PROPOSAL IS A WATERFRONT DOWNGRADE</a>, says a thoughtful reader commenting on <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">Kingston's
Disappearing Waterfront</a>.

<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=44.226251,-76.481377&amp;spn=0.002652,0.007167&amp;t=h&amp;z=18" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/http://maps.google.com/maps'); " target="_blank">

<p>Here's the problem:

<p>In prior years, <strong>the seawalls of Block D</strong>, some 200 linear meters worth, <strong>were commonly used for docking</strong>, including docking very large boats.  The Block D seawall was also used for RC model boat competitions.

<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/planning/blockd/BlockDPark_Phase1.pdf" target="_blank">
The current proposal for Token Park</a>  has the seawall <strong>finished with stone boulders</strong>, just like most of Kingston's waterfront.

<p><strong>Which begs these questions</strong>: </p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:1em;">Why does this shoreline, already <strong>well under cover of the Confederation Basin boulder breakwall</strong>, need to have a boulder-block finish?<p></li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;">Doesn't Kingston have <strong>enough inacessible boulder seawalls</strong> already?</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;">Why is the City of Kingston apparently settling for <strong>the minimum-cost-to-Brit-Smith option</strong> while rendering 200m of shoreline completely inaccessible and dysfunctional?</li>
</ol>

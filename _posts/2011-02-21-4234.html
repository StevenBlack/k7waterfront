<p><strong><a href="http://www.ontariorealty.ca/Assets/What+We+Do/Major+projects/Kingston+Provincial+Campus/Kingston+Provincial+Campus+PIC2+ad.pdf" title="Link to the public meeting PDF" target="_blank">UNDER THE RADAR,</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> </strong>, to say the least, is the apparent done-deal about the future of the <strong>122-acre waterfront KPH property</strong> on King Street West.</p>

<p><strong>So typical too</strong>: An imminent public meeting, and absolutely no details about plans are online. </p>

<p><strong>To paraphrase</strong>: <em>Come to the meeting to read all about our done-deal, <strong>presented to you on poster-boards</strong>.  Queue before each one, 5 to 10-deep, and read 'em.</em></p>

<p>This is bullshit.  This form of  <em>"Community Engagement"</em> ought to be unlawful. This is exactly how we ended-up with our ruined, inaccessible, and screwed-up waterfront.</p>

<p>Public meetings should occur only <strong>after ALL plans are posted online for review</strong> and citizens have had sufficient time to  prepare for the meeting.</p>

<p>Must hand it to them: it's <strong>a perfect way to run a railroad</strong>.</p>

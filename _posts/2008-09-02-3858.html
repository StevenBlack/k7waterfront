<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2008/A18_Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">
AT COUNCIL TONIGHT</a>  is a motion to...
<blockquote><p>"....prevent any development within 120 m of the high water mark of the Rideau waterway from the Lasalle Causeway to the northern boundary of the city without the permission of Council."</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Most people don't realize the northern extent of the City of Kingston. </strong>
<p>FYI, this motion includes:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Cataraqui River</strong> (both shores)</li>
<li><strong>Colonel By Lake</strong> (both shores)</li>
<li>The South shore of <strong>River Styx</strong></li>
<li>The South Shore of <strong>Cranberry Lake</strong></li>
<li>The South Shore of <strong>Little Cranberry Lake</strong></li>
<li>The South Shore of part of <strong>Whitefish Lake</strong></li>
<li>And both shores, or just the South shore, of <strong>all the waterways interconnecting the above</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is a job for a proper Conservation Authority</strong>, one that doesn't give a rats-ass if your name is Brit Smith or Byron Springer.

<p>Details <a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1180821" target="_blank">
in The Whig</a>, but there is no sense therein of the full extent of this.

<p>As we approach July, <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" target="_blank">
Lake Ontario water levels</a>  are still about six inches below average, and about four inches below last year's level at this time.  The forecast calls for levels to rise through July, when historically levels fall.<p>

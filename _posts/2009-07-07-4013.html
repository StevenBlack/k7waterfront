COMMENT ONLINE</a>  on the city website about the <strong>proposed renaming of Breakwater Park</strong> in honor of Lt.-Col John Bradstreet.

<p><strong>Renaming the park after John Bradstreet</strong> is a <strong>stupid idea</strong>.  Here's why:

<ul>
<li>Bradstreet's <strong>troop-strength ratio was about 25-to-1</strong>, a significant fact the city never mentions in its 'comment-online' background information.</li>
<li>Bradstreet's troops quickly took Fort Frontenac, <strong>trashed it</strong>, then they departed.</li>
<li>Bradstreet <strong>never spent a single eighteenth-century winter here</strong>.</li>
<li>There's no evidence John Bradstreet <strong>ever built a damn thing here</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any questions?  See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_fort_frontenac" title="Link to 'Battle of Fort Frontenac' in Wikipedia" target="_blank">Battle of
Fort Frontenac</a>  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bradstreet" title="Link to 'John Bradstreet' in Wikipedia" target="_blank">John Bradstreet's
2-paragraph article</a>  in Wikipedia.

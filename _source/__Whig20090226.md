##Letter: Why subsidize boaters?
I would like to hear an explanation for the $320,000 taxpayer subsidy for our city's two publicly owned marinas. With 639 slips, I'm quite positive this amount could be absorbed by the boat owners without much of a hiccup. There seems to be a healthy waiting list of boaters who would snap up any spots left vacant by boat owners who can't afford a slight raise in their dockage fees. If not, let me be the first in line for my taxpayer-subsidized parking spot downtown that I would use to spend money on entertainment, shopping and restaurants.

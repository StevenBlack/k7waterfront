2015 TORONTO PAN-AMERICAN GAMES BID</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, specifically the sailing event, is discussed in Wednesday's Whig.

<p>What The Whig doesn't tell us is the Toronto bid has been <a href="http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081003.wspt-toronto-panam-03/GSStory/GlobeSportsOther/home" target="_blank">

<p>There's more: Ontario Premier <strong>Dalton McGuinty was on-hand in Acapulco, Mexico to launch the bid</strong> just prior to Thanksgiving.  The Toronto bid is <a href="http://www.toronto2015.org/en/blog/1641_toronto-2015-video" target="_blank">slick</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> ; their ducks are aligned.  <strong>Harvey Rosen wasn't on the trip</strong>.

<p>From <a href="http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081003.wspt-toronto-panam-03/GSStory/GlobeSportsOther/home" target="_blank">
The Globe and Mail</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, three weeks ago on October 3rd:
<blockquote>
<p>The bid is Toronto-branded, meaning organizers will peddle the Pan Am bid internationally using the country's largest city as a hook. However, Toronto's main events likely will be the opening and closing ceremonies. <strong>Sports venues are most likely to go into the region covered by the 905 area code: Vaughan, Markham, Durham, Peel-Halton and the Niagara Region</strong>.
</blockquote>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.toronto2015.org/en/home/" target="_blank">bid home page</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  There's nothing specific there yet.

<p>But there's definitely a sense that <strong>Kingston's on the outside, looking-in</strong> at this point.

<p>More to the point: each time Toronto bids for a major games, <strong>why is Kingston always the supplicant for the sailing event?</strong>  It's worth asking: Hey Toronto! <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ListOfMajorRegattasInKingston" target="_blank">what's
your problem</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> ?

<p>Maybe one reason Toronto seems to come-up short in its games bids is because of <strong>Toronto's inability to leverage its proven world-class, world-renowned assets, like Kingston for sailing</strong>, for example.

<p>Another way to look at it is: if the Toronto 2015 bid <em>doesn't</em> showcase Kingston for sailing, then perhaps Toronto doesn't deserve to win.  Certainly everyone will know, at least as far as sailing is concerned, that it's all about the politics, not the competitors.

<p><strong>What's not in doubt</strong> is this: Since 1976 Summer Games, <strong>Kingston hasn't been resting on its laurels</strong>.  <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ListOfMajorRegattasInKingston" target="_blank">Kingston
has earned it</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

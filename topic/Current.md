##There is current in Kingston Harbour

Not a lot, but **it varies across the harbour**.
<h3>Basic patterns</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Generally surface current sets from West to East as Lake Ontario flows into the St. Lawrence River.
 <li> Surface current is increased by recent rainfall and by sustained Westerly breezes.
 <li> Surface current is reduced in sustained Easterly breezes.
</ul>
<h3>Bottom profile</h3>
Looking at the bottom profile in the diagrams of Kingston Harbour below, it's easy to see that
<ul>
 <li> The channel is deepest close to the North Shore,
 <li> generally much shallower areas are found close to the South Shore, and
 <li> the South side of Kingston harbour is protected by large shoals to the West.
</ul>

**Therefore**, in most prevailing breezes (S, SW, W, NW), current favours the South side of Kingston Harbour (left) when sailing upwind, and current favours the North side of Kingston Harbour when sailing downwind.

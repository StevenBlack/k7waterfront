SCUBA DIVING MAGAZINE</a>  has a brief article on diving near Kingston, now online from its March issue.  The article covers three wrecks: The George A. Marsh, The Comet, and The Wolfe Islander II.

<p>From the introduction:

<blockquote>
<p>With upward of 24 known moored wrecks, including schooners, barges and passenger ships, Kingston, Ontario, is a tempting destination for cold-water wreck divers. In fact, more than 400 ships are known to have wrecked in the area.

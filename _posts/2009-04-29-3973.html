The Canada Gazette published the Small Vessel Regulations on April 25th.  There is a 30 day comment period which ends May 25.

<p>Here are some of the <strong>notable changes in the pleasure craft section</strong> of the proposed regulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A heavy-duty a <strong>marine emergency first-aid kit</strong> will be required.</li>
<li>Fire extinguishers will only be <strong>acceptable for a period of 6 years</strong> after date of manufacture.</li>
<li><strong>Only Canadian approved PFDs</strong> and/or lifejackets are allowed - this is currently the case, a fine point that many don't realize. </li>
<li>A <strong>copy of a boat license</strong> must be on board.  (This assumes a proper boat licensing system)</li>
<li><strong>Boat licenses</strong> will have to renewed every 10 years. </li>
<li>If you are under 16, your lifejacket must be <strong>inherently buoyant</strong> (disallowing inflatables?)</li>
<li>You will need to have a <strong>magnetic compass</strong>. </li>
<li>They are making <strong>changes in the different size categories</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>currently:</strong> <6, 6<8, 8<12m (3-categories)</li><li><strong>proposed:</strong> <6, 6<9, 9<12, 12<24m (4-categories)</li></ul></li>
</ul>

##Waterfront In Flux
<h3>The water lots (Since 2006)</h3>
Since 2006 it's been known that [[__Whig20061204|the Federal Government intends to rid itself of 7.5km of water lots]] between Belle Island in the Cataraqui River to Lake Ontario Park in Kingston's west end. A change in ownership of these water lots can potentially mean lots of changes in how these are used, or can be used.


<h3>Federal wharves</h3>
See Water Lots.  Nearby precedents: Rockport, and Horne's.

In Kingston, the Marine Museum's outer wharves?


<!-- <h3>Parking at the King St filtration plant<br>(since 2008)</h3>A waterside parking area is being arbitrarily managed, sometimes open, sometimes gated.  This really affects board/kite sailors, but other park users as well.  Getting a straight answer on this from **Utilities Kingston** is apparently too much to ask. -->

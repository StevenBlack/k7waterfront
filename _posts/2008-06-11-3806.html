<p><a href="http://www.wfchallenge.com" target="_blank">The Waterfront Challenge</a>  is a national <em>[ed: actually, North American]</em> competition to encourage people who care about their local waterfront, to improve their local waterfront.

<p>The Challenge is designed for any group of three or more people who want to spend a minimum of two days of their lives improving their local waterfront and encouraging others to do the same. Projects should be new, and make some part of your waterfront an environmentally better place.

<p>Seven regional awards of $5,000 each will be presented, along with a separate grand prize of $25,000.  Canada is considered a region.  Projects must be completed by November 5 2008.

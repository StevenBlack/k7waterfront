CITY PURCHASES LAND</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  adjacent to Grass Creek Park.

<p>That's good, but the announcement is prefixed with:

<blockquote>
<p>...in accordance with municipal policies for developing and sustaining public access to the City's waterfront.
</blockquote>

<p>... which is <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=651123&amp;catname=Local+News&amp;classif=" target="_blank">
baloney</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, also <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=648079&amp;catname=Local%20news" target="_blank">
here</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, citing two much closer and pertinent counterexamples from just last week alone.

<p>Also, looking at the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/PropertyNextToGrassCreek.jpg" target="_blank">photo</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, there's really not much new waterfront there.  So the whole waterfront angle to this story appears a little overblown.

<p>Update: <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20070824" target="_blank">A report</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  from the August 24th edition of the Whig Standard, which leads with:
<blockquote><p>Kingston has taken one more step toward securing the public use of its waterfront by purchasing 45 acres of riverside property on the city's far east side.</blockquote>

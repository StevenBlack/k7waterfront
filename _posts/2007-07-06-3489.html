THEATRE Wednesday night at Collins Bay Marina</a>  as the OPP Marine Unit books a sailor from a group of several yachts from Rochester NY traveling together.

<p>The individual was in small tender, simply going from C-Dock to A-Dock, from one docked yacht to another, while impaired.

<p>Word around the marina is there was no party going on, sleeping boaters on "C" and "A" docks heard nothing unusual, and the guy apparently wasn't lippy with the cops.

<p>There are, of course, two ways to view this.

<p>But there are lessons here: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Should you be operating a vessel while impaired?  No.

  <li> Is the Kingston OPP Marine Unit over-zealous?  Apparently so.  But then again, nobody witnessed the arrest, and few of us can list hauling corpses out of the water among our duties, so it's hard to say.

  <li> What might this incident cost in American tourism terms? That's incalculable.

  <p>Moreover: How does this story come to find its way onto CKWS-TV News?
</ul>
<p>You decide.  It's all about choices people make, on both sides of the badge.

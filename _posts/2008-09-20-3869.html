TWO WATERFRONT-RELATED ITEMS ON THE AGENDA</a>  of the City's Arts, Recreation & Community Policies Committee meeting of Thursday September 25th.
<ul>
<li> Status Report on the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/community/agenda/2008/ARC_A0908-SchedD.pdf" target="_blank">
Richardson Beach and bath house enhancements</a>.  Beware, the diagrams in this document's exhibits are unreadable.  The City Clerk's office actually does work to make the illustrations unreadable, as opposed to simply "Print to PDF" which would give us a perfect copy.  Better version <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/img/maps/parks/RichardsonBeach_Plans.jpg" target="_blank">

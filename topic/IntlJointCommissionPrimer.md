##LAKE ONTARIO WATER LEVELS AVERAGE, 1% AND 99% PROBABILITY OF EXCEEDENCE PLOTS###Showing **Plan 1958DD**, **Plan B+**, and **Plan 2007** only.

**'Plan B+ (blue) produces better environmental results through more variability in levels white Plan 2007 (yellow) strikes a balance that conserves more of the benefits currently provided under regulation.**' -- (Quoting the IJC)

##Things to know about the IJC plans* The flow water from Lake Ontario is principally controlled by the [http://flickr.com/search/?q=Moses+Saunders&m=text](Moses-Saunders Hydro-Electric Dam) at Cornwall Ontario and Messina New York.
* In addition to dam at Cornwall, the [http://flickr.com/photos/whitebeard/2448469145/](Long Sault Dam) at Long Sault, Ontario acts as a spillway when outflows are larger than the capacity of the power dam.  Also the [http://flickr.com/photos/youstamy/1222100624/](Iroquois Ice Dam) at Iroquois, Ontario is principally used to help form a stable ice cover and regulate water levels at the power dam.
* There levels of Lake Ontario have been governed by **Plan 1958DD**.
* Proposed **Plan B+** would generally provide for more variance in water levels, and generally this plan's levels peak earlier than the other two plans.
* Proposed **Plan 2007** is the plan we're likely to get, and it isn't really much different than Plan 1958DD, except in low water conditions.
##About the graph aboveThe graph above was taken from a document titled ****Proposed new Order and Plan 2007**** published by the [http://www.ijc.org](International Joint Commission), with the following changes applied here:
<ol>
<li> The graph was scanned from the document.
<li> Plotted lines representing "Plan A+" (red) and "Plan D+" (green) **were removed** from the graph to make the graph more immediately understandable and because "Plan A+" and "Plan D+" are not really part of the discourse anymore.
<li> Therefore the graph now shows only the three plans that are part of the public discourse in May 2008.
</ol>
For reference, in early May 2008 we're seeing water levels [http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews042008.html#3783](45 inches above chart datum) or a level of **247 feet**.

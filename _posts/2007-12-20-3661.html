<p>Someone created a Google <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=113473824011614029353.000437202a780afd72b90" target="_blank">
KITEBOARDING KINGSTON - RIDING MAP</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  Big Sandy Bay is mis-identified, but the rest is great.

<p>For example:

<blockquote>
<p><strong>PUC Dock</strong>

<p>Kingston's most popular summer launch site, good from east through west on the south side of the compass, best in SW winds...but it really comes to life in a true west once the swell gets bigger and cleans up a bit. Best catagorized as "bump and jump" with a nice little carvatorium on the inside at the pipe.

<p>Though this is a very accessible launch it is an intermediate level spot at least. There is a slight current, and limited landing spots downwind. Jump off the dock to launch, but make sure you make it in before the last little beach upwind of the hospital! If you miss that your best bet is to ride it out and come in WAAAAY downwind at the base of Fort Henry. Not a bad planned downwinder for those on the early stages of the learning curve. Bring a quarter and call a cab from the pay phone at the entrance to the fort to get back to the PUC docks.

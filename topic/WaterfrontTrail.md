##Kingston is not on the Waterfront Trail!
<div class="sidebar">
For now, this is a to-do:
<blockquote><p>I like your draft waterfront web site. You might want to speak to <b>Ross Forest</b> or <b>Barbara Bradfield</b> about the Waterfront Trail and all the trouble they have had getting Kingston to get with it. The trail runs right around Lake Ontario on the Canada side, with Kingston as a missing link. The city even has the signs to post along Highway 2 to the east of the Cataraqui River and just doesn't seem to want to put them up.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/News.aspx?Report=Beach" target="_blank"><img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/HealthUnitBeachReport2008-07.jpg" alt="Health Unit Beach Report July 2008" class="floatright"/></a>
<p><strong>FINALLY</strong> the KFL&amp;A Health Unit has a <a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/News.aspx?Report=Beach" target="_blank">dedicated
beach report web page</a>.

<p>Getting that took <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews062007.html#3467" target="_blank">
over a year</a>.  Think: <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews062008.html#3813" target="_blank">
pulling teeth</a>.

<p><strong>Another plus</strong>: The Health Unit's page <strong>lists 41 beaches</strong>, covering a wide area.

<p>By contrast, the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/index.asp" target="_blank">
City of Kingston's "Environment" page</a>  lists just <strong>11 city beaches plus Big Sandy Bay</strong>.

<p><strong>But</strong> the Health Unit lists <strong>four swimming spots</strong> in the City that, for some reason, <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/index.asp" target="_blank">
don't appear on the City website</a> :
<ul class="simplebullet">
<li>The <strong>PUC dock</strong> at the foot of Collingwood street,
<li>the <strong>Collins Bay Pier</strong>,
<li><strong>Lemoine Point</strong> which, oddly, the Health Unit classifies under "Cataraqui Conservation Authority".  This area is within the City of Kingston, and should be listed as such.
<li>What they call <em>"Lake Ontario Hospital"</em>, which is either behind the <strong>Kingston Psychiatric Hospital</strong>, or <strong>Breakwater Park</strong>.  We're supposed to guess.

</ul>
<p>So the City and the Health Unit currently aren't on the same page when it comes to keeping swimmers healthy.

<p><strong>Downsides</strong>: The Health Unit and the City of Kingston can't seem to agree on names for some beaches.  <strong>Respect for our beaches surely starts with referring to them properly</strong> in official communications.

<p><strong>Here's what needs to drastically improve next</strong> because <strong>this still isn't good enough</strong>.  Vital information still isn't being disclosed, like:
<ul class="simplebullet">
<li><strong>The date</strong> of the sample was collected.
<li><strong>The specific level of <em>E.coli</em> found</strong>, as they do in <a href="http://www.hpechu.on.ca/applications/web_cms/index.php?pageid=550&amp;menuid=1570" target="_blank">
Hastings &amp; Prince Edward Counties</a>.
<li><strong>How, exactly, was the sample collected</strong>?  Was it from a boat perhaps hundreds of feet off the beach, or within a few yards of the waterline where children actually swim?
</ul>

swimmable Lake Ontario</a>, Lake Ontario Waterkeeper Podcast from June 5, 2008.  This covers, in detail, what's wrong with the current state of beach reporting around Lake Ontario.

<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> thanks for <em>finally</em> creating a web page, but we really need way better information to make choices.  See, for example, the <a href="http://www.hpechu.on.ca/applications/web_cms/index.php?pageid=550&amp;menuid=1570" target="_blank">

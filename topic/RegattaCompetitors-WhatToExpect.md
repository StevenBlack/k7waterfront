This page serves to provide ''general information for first-time competitors'' who come to Kingston for a sailing regatta.

For details specifically related to sailing, see the [[regatta competitors home page]].

<strong>Background</strong>
What's written here is general, and may or may not reflect the some of the conditions of your particular event.

<strong>Always read your Notice of Race and your Sailing Instructions</strong> because what you read here means nothing.

Kingston hosts a variety of regattas each year which have differing <strong>scale</strong>, <strong>stakes</strong>, and <strong>safety</strong> considerations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale</strong>: You could be here for a 10-boat event with the whole harbour to yourselves, or you might be one of 120 boats in a class that is part of a larger 600-boat multi-class event.  The scale of the event will certainly dictate what you'll be facing here, and determine what's expected of you.

<li><strong>Stakes</strong>: Generally speaking, the larger the stakes, the tighter the rules and procedures of the regatta.

<li><strong>Safety</strong>: Always a concern, there's just no cutting corners here, and no excuse for not being aware and following what's proscribed in your NOR and SI's.
</ul>

Here are some of the things that might be specified in your Notice of Race or Sailing Instructions.
<strong>Inspection and Measurement</strong>
Typically this depends on the regatta stakes.
<ul>
<li>Typically all boats are expected to meet class measurement expectations.
<li>Sometimes a formal pre-regatta measurement is required.
<li>Sometimes inspections and measurement can happen while the regatta is underway.
</ul>

<strong>Launch</strong>
Typically regatta launch procedures depend on the regatta's scale.
<ul>
<li>For small adult events, maybe you'll launch your own boat, when you want, end of story.
<li>For larger events, there may be a whole crew of volunteers to help things run smooth.
<li>You may be required to sail uniquely from a particular harbour.
<li>Some parts of Kingston Harbour, like other clubs and marinas, might be declared out-of-bounds.
<li>Launching may be at the direction and assistance of a launch crew.  Obey, and wait your turn.
<li>If you are racing a keelboat, hauling out may or may not be permitted to keep things fair.
<li>As you sail out of the harbour, you may have to make your sail number evident to record-keeping volunteers at the harbour mouth.
</ul>

<strong>Coaches</strong>
Depending on the scale and stakes of the regatta, coaches may...
<ul>
<li>...be required to register with the regatta office.
<li>...be constrained in their interactions with competitors.
<li>...be required to assist at the request of the Race Committee.
</ul>

<strong>Coach Boats</strong>
Coach boats may...
<ul>
<li>...be required to display a flag.
<li>...be constrained in location or activity.
<li>...be required to assist for safety or other tasks at the request of the Race Committee.
<li>...be required to accept garbage from lunches and snacks.
<li>...or may not be permitted on-water.
</ul>

##Misrepresenting Kingston waterfront
You're looking at the last page of the ''''Spring and Summer 2009 City of Kingston Recreation and Leisure Magazine''''.

This full-page ad purports to showcase some great things "On the Water", therefore supposedly related to some degree to our waterfront.

''Bullshit!''

The items circled, the Kingston Buskers Rendezvous, and the Limestone City Blues Festival, nave '''NOTHING''' whatsoever to do with our waterfront.

In fact, if you go to these events, you'll be greeted by the [[http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront locked gates of Confederation Basin Marina]].

''Who is well-served by misleading residents and visitors about our waterfront?''

Look at the list as a whole.  How many of these events are about getting people in, or on, the water?

''Just two''.
<ol>
<li>At the [[http://collinsbaymarina.com/SafeBoating.html Don't Rock The Boat]] event at Collins Bay Marina (which is really great) you can try canoes and kayaks, and you can take a ride in a powerboat.  Lots of other things too. </li>

<li>At the Kingston Kids Perch Fishing Derby at POH you and your kids will be on a dock with a fishing rod in-hand.</li>
</ol>

None of those two water-accessiblity focused events is near downtown.

Everything else is athletes, dragon boat teams, or out-of-town power-boaters only.

That sums-up our so-called "wonderful waterfront".  ''It's pathetic'', to be brutally honest.

Kingston's waterfront resource is, if anything, ''a spectacular underachievement''.

<p>At issue before Council tonight, the City of Kingston proposes to rent an office at Portsmouth Olympic Harbour to <a href="http://www.cliftsmarine.com/" target="_blank">Clifts Marine Sales of
Toronto</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  whose homepage already touts this as a done deal.   Note the rent.  We're guessing this is the thin edge of the wedge, and it's only a matter of time before they start renting docks and using POH as a major sales centre.

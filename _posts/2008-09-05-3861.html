AT RAVENSVIEW</a>, from Allen Lucas, Utilities Kingston engineer.</p>
<blockquote><p>It gives me great pleasure to inform everyone that on September 4th at about 4:00 pm, <strong>wastewater was started flowing through the Biological Aerated Filters</strong>. This signifies the culmination of a lot of hard work and tremendous effort on the part of the construction team, the engineering team and Utilities Kingston operations staff.</p></blockquote>

<strong>Course Foxtrot</strong> is Kingston's open water sailing regatta circle that is used for many world and continental championships.

Over the years, [many major championships][listofmajorregattasinkingston] have been hosted on Course Foxtrot.

Course Foxtrot is usually the "outside" race circle when sailing instructions provide for racing "inside" (in the harbour) or "outside" (beyond [Snake Island][snakeisland]) at the discretion of the Race Committee.

<h2 class="plain">For competitors
* Course Foxtrot is quite some sailing distance from [Portsmouth Olympic Harbour][portsmoutholympicharbour].
<h2 class="plain">For race officers
* There is a popular [SCUBA dive wreck][wrecks], really it's two wrecks, the <i>Aloha</i> and the <i>Effie Mae</i> in the vicinity.  The general area is fairly large and you have options when you set-up racing and both racing and diving activities can be accommodated.
* If no SCUBA activity is evident or expected then you can set your course over the wreck, which is about 55-feet down.
* <strong>both 1 1/4-mile and 1 1/2-mile diameter SAMPLE circles</strong> are shown in the diagram.  Weather legs up to 2-miles in length or longer are possible on Course Foxtrot.

<h2 class="plain">Boat traffic
Expect pleasure boat traffic on Foxtrot to be light as much traffic between Kingston Harbour and Lake Ontario will transit through the South Side of Simcoe Island.  Any traffic you will see is most probably headed for buoy KS2 on the South Side of Snake Island Bank.

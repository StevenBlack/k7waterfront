##June 2007 Issues
<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/MarineMuseumDockWharfs.jpg" class="image1px floatleft">**Moving the Sir Alexander Henry into the historic part of the Marine Museum drydock.**

The reason for moving the Alexander Henry is that the east wharf is crumbling above, but especially below, the water.

As a result, the movement of the hull caused by winds has strained the bollards on the east wharf to the point that there are now structural cracks in the retaining walls around the bollards.

The East Wharf has been it its current configuration for decades.

Divers doing inspections were able to pull chunks out of the timbers (just to see if they could do it).  Over time "large voids" have developed behind the wharf's timber walls where the fill has spilled out onto the floor of the berths.

The Alexander Henry cannot go to the West Wharf because it is also crumbling.

The only alternate place that has been mentioned that could take her is the wharf at the psych hospital, which is much more exposed to the weather.

No mention of the north side of the causeway just to the east of the bridge opening.  Hallco motor canallers tied up there in the 1970s awaiting a tow to the scrapyard.  That spot was specifically designed for ships drawing at least 14' to tie up.  Maybe this has silted up?  This has not been included as a possible location.

**Scrapping the HENRY?**
If they sell the ship to the Port Colborne scrap yard (now the only one in Canada) they estimate it would take eight weeks to arrange a tow and make space at the yard, and it must be done before the wind picks up in September.  "sell" means the scrap yard will take her, and pay nothing, if the museum pays for the tow to get her there.  Even a year ago the yard there was talking about paying at least something for her, but no longer.

Note that **environmental concerns are closing down so many scrap yards** that owners may soon have to pay to get the remaining yards to take them, in addition to paying for the tow to get them there. (which the scrap yards used to pay).</div>

**Into the Drydock**
As for moving into the drydock, she presently is in a level trim with only a calculated 1.8" clearance to get over the sill of the dock.  Lake levels begin to fall rapidly in mid June.

If she gets in, **the federal government would require**, among other things
<ul>
<li>that the city pay for any damages to the limestone (historic) part of the dock (that is the part they would put her in),
<li>that the city save the Crown harmless for any injury, loss or damage,
<li>that the city accept responsibility for any contamination due to paint, sewage, etc.  etc.  etc.
<li>and more.
</ul>

Other costs:
<ul>
<li>The bollards of the historical drydock have to be tested to see if they can still hold her in high winds.  Until that testing is done temporary bollards would have to be made out of bundles of highway traffic curbs (the high kind) or something.
<li>New bollards are included in the price to replace the current ones if they are needed.
<li>Four fenders, heavy timber rafts of sufficient size to fill the space between the ship and the dock walls on each side, would have to be built.
<li>Archaeological studies would have to be done before new bollards could be built.
<li>Plus environmental,
<li>plus 30% contingency
</ul>

**Total: about $175k**

The dock door is probably the weakest link in the whole deal, followed by the two crumbling concrete extensions of the original dock (you can take out concrete with your hands).  Everyone seems to think the actual historic limestone drydock, the part nearest the lake, is probably solid since the one at Esquimalt built by the same contractor, to roughly the same design, at almost the same time, is still in almost daily use. After all, the stones weigh 3 tons, and up, each and the dock was designed to be empty for months at a time.

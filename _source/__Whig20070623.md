<strong>Beaches test clean</strong>
Local news - Saturday, June 23, 2007 @ 00:00

Kingston's beaches remained open yesterday afternoon despite problems at beaches in communities to the east and west.

The Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington Public Health Unit said that people using the city's popular swimming beaches, including Richardson beach, Rotary and Grass Creek parks, have not been warned against swimming there.

One beach in Prince Edward County was found yesterday to have unacceptable levels of bacteria when tested by the Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit.

Last summer, the beaches at Grass Creek, Rotary and Village beach in Bath were closed to swimmers due to elevated levels of E.coli bacteria in late July and early August. It was the first time in 14 years that swimming had been prohibited at those beaches due to bacteria in the water.

Green-and-white signs stating, "Swimming is not recommended in this area because of pollution," were posted at all three.

The beaches are regularly tested during the summer for higher-than-normal bacteria counts, which can cause gastro-intestinal illnesses in people.

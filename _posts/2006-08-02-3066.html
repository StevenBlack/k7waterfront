<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/tenders/TENDER-UK0608.asp" target="_blank">
Utilities Kingston Tender</a>  posted August first, closing August 16th, for work that must be done before December 15th 2006.  Therein:
<blockquote>
<li>Landscaping of the on-shore areas of the east and west shores of the Great Cataraqui River - the naturalization of 5,800m2 on the west shore, the restoration of the east shore and landscaping in the vicinity of the River Street Sewage Pumping Station, including Douglas L. Fluhrer Park.<p>
<li>In-water fish compensation works in the Great Cataraqui River - construction of an artificial reef on the east shore of the Great Cataraqui River and the installation of ten (10) root wads on shoreline areas.
</blockquote>
All this seems ridiculously short-notice and cross-diciplinary.  The City of Kingston stumbles on without sense or vision for the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/GreatCataraquiRiver" target="_blank">Cataraqui
River</a>.

<p><strong>BIG BREEZE TODAY</strong> was the tipping point for ice-breakup in Kingston Harbour.

<p>See <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/k7waterfront/" target="_blank">these
photos</a>  courtesy of Frances O'Neill of ice floes pushed-up on the shore at <a href="http://kingstonyachtclub.com" target="_blank">KYC</a>.

<p>Look closely: the ice pushed-up a large part of the rocky beach.

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> See also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wombom/sets/72157615144881266/" target="_blank">these
photos</a>  from Chris Walmsley</a>, also taken at KYC, including <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wombom/3348547341/in/set-72157615144881266/" target="_blank">
this one</a>  of the ice crumpling an iron fence.  The photos also show <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wombom/3348667315/in/set-72157615144881266/" target="_blank">
yesterday's wind graph</a>  which peaks at 100 KM/H (60 MPH on the graph).

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> All this is reminiscent of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews022006.html#2920" target="_blank">
this scene on February 17 2006</a>, only this year is worse because thick ice floes are far more damaging than water.  Peak wind on that day was 84 KM/H.

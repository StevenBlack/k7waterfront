<p>AFTER RACING DAY TWO AT THE ISAF YOUTH WORLDS, we can start to say the regatta's eventual winners will have really earned it.

<p>Winds started West and fair but it picked up and backed suddenly around 11:30am and, by first guns at noon it was snorting.  It mostly built from there.

<p>Yellow Course was set at 245 degrees, and that never changed.  By session's end around 2:30pm, with gusts close to 30 at times and with carnage looming, they called it a day.  Another good call.

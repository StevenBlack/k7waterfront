##A place for advising Kingston residents about making the most of Kingston's waterfront
<div class="context">
You live in Kingston.  You're aware of the water, but you don't feel a connection to it.  You sense you're missing out.
Surely there must be economical waterfront options for you. Discuss.
</div>
<h3>Enjoying your waterfront from shore</h3>
Kingston's waterfront has a lot to offer, and you don't need access to a boat to be connected to the water.
<ul>
<li> Check the calendar of [[upcoming events]]
<li> We have [[parks|many waterfront parks]] in Kingston.
<li> Learn and explore the [[major geographic features]] of Kingston's waterfront.
<li> We've got some [[beaches]], though they are unsupervised, not great quality, and it's likely they'll be posted.
</ul>

<h3>Get involved as a volunteer!</h3>
Many waterfront [[upcoming events]] need volunteers.
  <ul>
  <li> Volunteering is a great way to get yourself out on the water.
  <li> It's also a great way to meet great people.  Volunteers are givers.
  <li> Volunteer for [[http://cork.org/volunteer.html CORK]] which runs intensively through most of August but also all summer long.
  </ul>

<h3>Get proactive!</h3>
Most of Kingston's [[clubs|oustanding waterfront clubs]] offer:
  <ul>
  <li> Reasonably-priced introductions and courses for adults and children
  <li> Typically these are open to non-members.
  <li> Book these early in the Spring because they are often sold-out.
  <li> This typically comes with new-membership discounts that encourage course-taking non-members to join.
  </ul>

<h3>Get invited!</h3>
The majority of sailors, rowers, and powerboaters got their start because someone took them out on the water.  Consider simply asking someone to take you out.  It works!
<ul>
<li> We have many [[marinas]] in the region serving boaters who collectively own thousands of boats.
<li> Each one of those boats requires yearly maintenance, which comes from elbow-grease.
<li> Many of these boats require more than one person to operate, and many don't leave the dock for lack of crew.
<li> Therefore <strong>it never hurts to ask</strong>, especially it that comes with an <strong>offer or willingness to help</strong> with chores, or help with crewing.
<li> It doesn't hurt to have proper clothing, soft-soled shoes, a lifejacket, snacks, and beverages when attempting to get yourself invited.
</ul>

<h3>Get involved because it's a Good Thing</h3>
The reason Kingston's waterfront is fundamentally ruined is because citizens in the past allowed that to happen.
<ul>
<li> If something doesn't seem right, speak up.
<li> If a proposed waterfront development doesn't sit right with you, speak up.
<li> If a waterfront park isn't being maintained the way you'd like, call the City and complain about it.
<li> See trash washed-up on the shore?  Pick it up.
<li> Encourage others to do likewise.
</ul>

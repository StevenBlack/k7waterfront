<p>POKER RUN:  Today's Whig Standard lead story, complete with colour photo, proclaims: "<a href="http://www.thewhig.com/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=151779&amp;catname=Local%20News&amp;classif=" target="_blank">
Big boats lead to new business</a> ".
<blockquote><p>
The Thousand Islands Poker Run <i>proved</i> (sic) it is good for more than electrifying crowds and breaking speed limits over the weekend.
<p>For the first time in its 19-year history, the motorsport spectacle was parlayed into a showcasing weekend for companies looking to expand.
<p>A company in town for the event, which Kingston Economic Development Corp. general manager Jeff Garrah would not name ahead of an official announcement, committed to building a 15,000-square-foot facility that will create about 16 new jobs.
</blockquote>
<p>To put this into perspective, your average freestanding fast-food franchise represents as many full-time equivalent jobs as this.  This is evidently front-page KEDCO-lauding news in this town.
<p>Lower down:
<blockquote><p>
"We had spectator boats lining both sides of the river from Kingston all the way to Prescott," Taylor said. "That's the magnitude of this event."
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, like a sunny Saturday in August wouldn't otherwise be busy with boat traffic throughout the Thousand Islands.
<p>Our friends at KEDCO and Poker Runs America would be well advised to curb their collegial self-congratulations, and recognize the other boats standing clear for what it really was.

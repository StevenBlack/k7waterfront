<p><a href="http://www.heritagecruises.com/index.html" target="_blank">THE
18-PASSENGER GEORGIAN CLIPPER</a>  is the subject of a short piece in the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/_ChicagoTribune2007-04-01" target="_blank">Sunday
Chicago Tribune</a>.  The company plans <a href="http://www.heritagecruises.com/schedule_2007.html" target="_blank">20
sailings this season</a>, all of them based in Kingston.

<p>But it's a reminder that Kingston lacks sufficient deep-water docking to accommodate this sort of business on a larger scale. <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/_Whig2007-01-15" target="_blank">Moreover
what little we have is disintegrating</a>.

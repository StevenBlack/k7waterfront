<p>REMEMBER LAST YEAR?<p>

<p>That was then.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" title="Link to the US Army Corps of Engineers report on Great Lakes water levels." target="_blank">
LAKE ONTARIO WATER LEVEL FORECAST</a>  now <strong>predicts relatively low water throughout the summer</strong>.</p>

<p>Which is to say, at <strong>least a foot lower than last summer</strong> through the end of July.</p>

<p>Overall the bad news persists: <strong>the big lakes upstream</strong> -- Lakes Huron and Superior -- are still far below long-term averages.</p>

ONTARIO WATER LEVELS</a>  are looking good again, especially considering all the snow on the ground in the Great Lakes basin. </p>

<p>Currently Lake Ontario levels are about average for this time of year, after a period of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews112007.html#3626" target="_blank">
abnormally low water last fall</a>.</p>

<p>The good news is <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews112007.html#3626" target="_blank">
Lake Ontario levels are 10-inches above predictions from three
months ago</a>.

<p>The bad news: the big lakes upstream are still far below their seasonal averages.  Lake Superior is 10-inches below average, and lakes Michigan and Huron are about 20-inches low.

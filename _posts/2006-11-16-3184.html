<p>THE CITY OF KINGSTON <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">SEWER
BYPASS LOG</a>  has been rather slow with updates in the past few months.  Let's see how long it takes for them to acknowledge any bypasses resulting from these rains.

<p><strong>Update (Saturday Nov 18):</strong> The Whig reports <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=279499&amp;catname=Local%20News&amp;classif=News%20-%20Local" target="_blank">
the city dumped an estimated 50 million litres (50,000 cubic
metres) into our waterways this week</a>.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Utilities Kingston bypassed 14 million litres (14,000 cubic metres) at the Collingwood station, and
<li> 15 million litres (15,000 cubic metres) at the north end station.
<li> The OKill water-treatment plant was bypassed for 25 hours.
<li>There was also the unusual step of bypassing secondary treatment at the west-end sewage plant for 15 hours. The plant removed large solids from waste water but didnt purify it.
</ul>
On Thursday, about 35 mm of rain fell. With the added water from Wednesday night, the total for the two days was about 43 mm. Since Nov. 11, the city has seen 80 mm of rain that has seeped its way into sewers.

<p>No mention yet of any of this on the <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">City

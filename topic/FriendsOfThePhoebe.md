The Friends of [[The Phoebe]] is a not-for-profit civic group of volunteers who wish to contribute to the cultural history of our City. Our mission is to promote the long-term preservation of the historic steam launch Phoebe and encourage educational programming with the Phoebe as the centerpiece of a high quality Edwardian exhibit

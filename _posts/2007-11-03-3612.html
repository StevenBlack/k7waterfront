<p>After sunset, look for it in the north-east sky, one and a half palm-widths up from bright star Capella.  It is currently the third brightest "star" in the constellation of Perseus. It's visible all night.

<p>Comet Holmes was first discovered in 1892 and has an orbital period of 6.9 years.  It's interesting that Holmes reached perihelion in early May, and is currently on its way away from the Sun.  It's distance from the Earth is at its minimum now, at 1.62 AU, so this is likely as good as it will get.

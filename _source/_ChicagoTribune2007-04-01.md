<strong>ST. LAWRENCE SASHAY</strong>

The Thousand Islands and St. Lawrence Seaway highlight a leisurely four-night cruise that sails round-trip from Kingston, Ontario, stopping at picturesque and historic towns along the way. First port of call is Picton for a mini-bus tour of the area's orchards and wineries. Another night is spent anchored in Brockville, one of Ontario's oldest cities, renowned for its mansion and elaborate architecture.

While cruising in the St. Lawrence Seaway, <a href="http://www.heritagecruises.com/index.html">the 18-passenger Georgian Clipper</a> threads its way among massive oceangoing vessels and tiny isles, including Heart Island, home to Boldt Castle. Fares are $1,179, covering the cruise, all meals, shore excursions, port charges and provincial sales tax. Additional costs are gratuities, GST and transportation between home and Kingston. The earliest departure is June 13, and the latest is Oct. 9, with a total of 20 sailings over the season. (888-271-2628; www.heritagecruises.com)

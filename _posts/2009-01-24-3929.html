AMHERST ISLAND IS NOT LISTED</a>  among six new wind projects announced for Ontario on Friday.

<p>The closest to us is the proposed <a href="http://www.skypower.com/SKYPOWER2008/BYRAN/project_area.html" target="_blank">
64.5 MW Byran Wind Project</a>  in central Prince Edward County.

<p>Does it seem bizarre that the <a href="http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/Page.asp?PageID=122&amp;ContentID=6791&amp;SiteNodeID=134&amp;BL_ExpandID=&amp;BL_ExpandID" target="_blank">
announcement</a>, totalling almost 500 MW in rated-capacity, <strong>is couched foremostly as a job creation initiative</strong>?

<p>About the announcement, quoting the <a href="http://www.amherstislandwindinfo.com/history.htm" target="_blank">Amherst
Island Wind Info website</a> :
<blockquote>
<p> I assume the next RFP will have to pretty much start the process from scratch, as new proponents will be entering the bidding process. Hopefully this will take a year or so; the OPA hasn't announced its schedule yet.
</blockquote>

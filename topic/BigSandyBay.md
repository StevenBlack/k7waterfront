<h3>Big Sandy Bay by boat</h3>
Beware that Big Sandy bay is a lee shore with dodgy anchoring due to a fine sand bottom.  The bay is wide and shallows gradually so it can get very choppy very quickly if the breeze comes up.  You don't want to be anchoring in there for long if the wind rises and sustains above 10 knots.

Beware that the bottom at Long Point is very shallow.  Red can MH4 is a full nautical mile offshore.  Depending on your draft you can "cut the corner" at Long Point but anything inside 1500 feet from the point is simply not advisable.  Go real slow, and keep watch.

LAKE ONTARIO PARK MASTER PLAN - TERMS OF REFERENCE</a>  is a 7-page report just released by the City staff for a committee meeting later this week.
<blockquote>
<p>The Terms of Reference for the next phase are focused on finding a viable way of putting in place the vision and planning principles agreed to in the visioning exercise. The Phase I Planning Study achieved its goal of reaching a consensus on the future of Lake Ontario Park. Phase 2 of the park redevelopment process has three objectives which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To develop and recommend a multi-year strategic direction and plan for the revitalization and rejuvenation of the park as a public community facility;
<li>To ensure ongoing and inclusive community consultation throughout the development of the plan and the related implementation strategy; and
<li>To develop and recommend a long-term financing and budget strategy for the capital construction and operating costs necessary to implement and maintain the recommended development plan.
</ul>

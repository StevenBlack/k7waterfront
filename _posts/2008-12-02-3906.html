<p><strong>GONE ARE THE OLD-STYLE SHOAL MARKERS</strong> in Kingston Harbour.  This summer, the M.O.T. replaced them with much smaller, and much lower, cylindrical ones.</p>

<p>Beyond arcane trivia, why would this matter?</p>

<p>There are many factors that make Kingston Harbour a great place to race sailboats.   The axis of Lake Ontario, the narrowing and gradual funneling of the shorelines towards Kingston, the low-lying landmasses to the south and west, the landscapes inland that help generate thermal winds, these are all good.</p>

<p>For dinghy-racing sailors, another nice feature of Kingston Harbour is the fortunate positioning of both  <strong>Myles Shoal</strong> and <strong>Penitentiary Shoal</strong> which, until this summer, were both marked with large green buoys that were easily visible at a mile distance.  (See the chart below.)

<p><strong>Myles Shoal</strong> lies exactly 1/2 nautical mile off Kingston Yacht Club, almost directly into the teeth of prevailing breezes.  Myles Shoal makes a perfect first-target for a group of practice-racing dinghies as they leave shore.  The stretch between KYC and Myles Shoal has surely served for many-a-thousand dinghy tunings and warmups over the years.

<p>From there, <strong>Penitentiary Shoal</strong> lies <em>exactly</em> one nautical mile from Myles Shoal, a perfect practice distance.  This leg bears 272 degrees magnetic (ignoring <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/MagneticAnomalies" target="_blank">magnetic
anomalies</a> ), which is typically to the right of prevailing breezes, but this right-offset largely compensates for the <em>left-side bias</em> when racing in Kingston Harbour.  The result is usually a tactically balanced upwind practice-leg for a group of racing dinghies.  Perfect!

<p><strong>But the new shoal markers are smaller and lower</strong>, and can't be seen at a distance of one nautical mile when viewed from low on the water.  The markers are in the same positions as always, but there has been a significant downgrade in their recreational utility.  There are simply fewer obvious targets to sail-between now.  Kingston Harbour lost a dinghy-sailing intangible this summer.

<p>When the M.O.T. decided to swich-out the old shoal markers, it's likely nobody gave the dinghy-sailing aspect any thought whatsoever.

<p><strong>And so it goes</strong>: a really special waterfront slowly becomes an ordinary waterfront one step-at-a-time.</p>

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">Constantly
losing intangibles</a>, each one perhaps "no big deal" taken individually, eventually adds-up on aggregate.</p>

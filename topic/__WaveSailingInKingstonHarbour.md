This map of wave sailing spots was put together by long time wave sailor **Phil Harvey**.   It shows the location of the sites, and arrows indicate the best wind directions for each site.

In the text below, the normal wave heights at each site are the expected values for these directions in 25 knots of wind.

<a name="Amherst Inside Break" href="#Map Top"></a>##Amherst Inside Break
<p>4-5ft; Clean, long, waves and side-onshore starboard jumping conditions. Great jumps and rides, and good inside transitions in smooth water near shore. Really long rides (100 m) are possible if you make the connection from the shoal to the surf in the shallower water toward the Brothers rock bar.
This shallow shoal is a good depth for small surf all year round, and never shallow enough to have to worry about your fin. </p>
<a name="Amherst Outside Break">##Amherst Outside Break
<p>6-8ft; Only waves 6ft+ break here at low water, bigger at high water. Best in 30-35 kts when you get 10-12 ft swell, which gives 8-10 ft clean vertical faces and huge starboard jumps. You get a few hits on the huge wave before it closes out, then you can continue riding the smaller shoulders as
they continue into the shallower water. </p>
<a name="Brothers Shoal Break"></a>##Brothers Shoal Break
<p>3-5ft; Beach surf conditions and long rides possible in these small, clean waves. </p>
<a name="Upper Salmon Shoal"></a>##Upper Salmon Shoal
<p>6-8ft; Waves steepen up, but only the big ones break here. Good for port jumping and gybing on your way back to Salmon. </p>
<a name="Salmon Island Break"></a>##Salmon Island Break
<p>5-6ft rideable waves, and 6-8ft jumpable waves. You can occasionally hit big starboard jumps near the south point of the island as waves wrapping around both sides of the shallows collide into each other. Short rides. </p>
<a name="West Everett Break"></a>##West Everett Break
<p>4-5ft; Clean waves. Sideshore conditions. You can get long frontside rides into the bay on a good day. Surf too close in to shore for good starboard jumping. </p>
<a name="Point Pleasant Break"></a>##Point Pleasant Break
<p>5-6ft; Side onshore conditions. Great for big starboard jumps. Riding is a bit dangerous due to the unforgiving shoreline and wind shadow close to shore. Last stop in the south-wind jump run across from Patterson Point and Patterson Shoal. </p>
<a name="Patterson Shoal Break"></a>##Patterson Shoal Break
<p>5-6ft; Best for port jumps in a south wind or starboard jumps in a south-west. Good long run to build up speed before hitting these jump. Can get one or two good hits on a wave for riding. Best in low water (late season) conditions, since waves are usually too small to break in the high water of
the early season. </p>
<a name="Patterson Point Break"></a>##Patterson Point Break
<p>5-6ft; Starboard jumps and good rides. Side-onshore conditions on the east side of the point in a south-west wind make frontside hits possible. Waves do not connect with the shoal to the west, but you get longer breaking waves to the east of the point. </p>
<a name="Snake Island Break"></a>##Snake Island Break
<p>6-7ft; Good jumps and short rides, but fairly close to shore. You want to be a bit careful here not to get in too shallow. </p>
<a name="Snake Shoal Break"></a>##Snake Shoal Break
<p>6-8ft; Straight onshore conditions and nice long rides straight downwind. Jumps on either tack. This shallow shoal is good even in the early season high water. At low water, I wouldn't try to sail straight across this shoal. Instead, ride the surf down either side. </p>

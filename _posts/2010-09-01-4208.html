<p><strong>"WATERFRONT ACCESS" FINALLY</strong> appears to mean more than a future proximate footpath in a City of Kingston planning document.</p>

<p>This may be the first time that <strong>accessibility for shore diving</strong> is mentioned in a City of Kingston planning document.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2010/PLN_A1510-10072.pdf#page=12" title="Link to the Planning Committee PDF" target="_blank">Comprehensive Planning
Report to Planning Committee</a>  about the proposed Queen's Performing Arts Building at the Tett Centre says the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>...the residents of the City of Kingston have enjoyed access to the water from this location for many decades for both passive enjoyment and active recreation, such as scuba diving</strong>. The wreck of the HMS St. Lawrence, largest War of 1812 battleship to sail the great lakes is located in 2 metres of water in front of this property and has a close post war association with the subject property.</p>

<p><strong>The easement for public access along the waterfront will be included as part of the Site Plan Control process.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's one thing to compel others, like Queen's University in this case, to build-in waterfront access.  It would be nice if The City of Kingston did likewise for its own waterfront properties.</p>

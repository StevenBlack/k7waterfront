REPORT 2007</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is a 36-page PDF just released by <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/swim/lake_ontario_waterkeeper_relea.php" target="_blank">

beaches</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  are covered in the report:</p>
<ul class="simplebullet">
<li> Richardson Beach (they call it "Murney Tower")
<li> Grass Creek
<li> Rotary Park, (incorrectly identified as part of "Collins Bay Marina")
<li> Lemoine Beach
<li> Arrowhead Beach
<li> Crerar Beach

<p>Many of the observations arise from the abject neglect by our municipality for our beaches.

<p>That's not the only beach-related thing that's neglected by the City.

<p>On August 24th we were pleased to report that <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews082007.html#3555" target="_blank">
FINALLY WE HAVE AN ONLINE BEACH REPORT</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

<p>But our fears were well-founded: as it turns out, that online beach report is just another web page the City is unable to properly maintain.  There has been no update in the two months since August 24th when the information was first posted.

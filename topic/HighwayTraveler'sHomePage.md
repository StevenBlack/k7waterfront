*  See our [Kingston Mills Locks][kingstonmillslocks] page.
*  North of Highway 401, just 1 km from the Highway 15 exit, or 2.6 km from the Montreal Street exit, on Kingston Mills road.
*  The parking lot is just West of the swing bridge that spans the locks.
*  You'll find a park with picnic tables, shade trees, grassy areas, trails.
*  The site is clean and very well maintained.
*  Bring your own snacks.  There's nothing to buy here.  There are convenience stores at the corner of Kingston Mills Road and Highway 15, less than a mile from the locks.
*  Washrooms are wheel chair accessible.
*  Great spot for a swim.
*  Nice scenic walk along the four locks found there.
*  Interesting for kids to see how locks operate.  In the summer, there are lots of pleasure boats locking up and down.
*  Very nice rock climbing spot too.
*  It's very pretty, interesting for kids, free, and it's all just a minute from the 401.

### Chill in one of many [waterfront parks][parks]###<a href="http://K7Waterfront.org/Topic/Parks"><img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/ParksMap.jpg" class="floatright image1px"></a>

*  See our [waterfront parks][parks] page
*  All have picnic tables and benches
*  Kingston's parks maintenance is spotty.  Most are clean and fine, but a few suffer from neglect.  On balance the waterfront parks are better maintained than the rest.
*  See our [beaches][beaches] topic, though don't be surprised to find a beach is posted.

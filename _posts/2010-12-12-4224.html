<p>The request to tone-down the lighting seems reasonable.  There isn't much, if any, civil aviation in the region, especially at night.</p>

<p>Consider too that mariners have been negotiating the very treacherous approaches to Kingston Harbour with a minimum and decreasing level of lit buoyage for decades now.</p>

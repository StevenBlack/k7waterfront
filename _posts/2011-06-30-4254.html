<p>POKER RUNS AMERICA <a href="http://www.pokerrunsamerica.com/indexLinks/indexpraevents2011.html" target="_blank">
final 2011 schedule</a>  is more modest than the one published <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews012011.html#4230" target="_blank">
last January</a>.<p>

<p>Back then there were <strong>six poker runs</strong> scheduled in the immediate region or closeby.</p>

<p>Evidently the events in <strong>Valleyfield</strong>, <strong>Gananoque</strong>, and <strong>Muskoka</strong> have been scrubbed.</p>

<p>The 1000 Islands Poker Run (labeled <a href="http://www.pokerrunsamerica.com/indexLinks/indexpraevents2011.html" target="_blank">
"THE BIGGEST, MEANEST and BADDEST"</a> ) stinks-up Kingston Harbour August 5-7, which is <strong>one day longer</strong> than originally advertised.</p>

<p>Kingston Marina used two cranes to haul out this 60ft. tug yesterday for a Transport Canada inspection.   This boat is due back in the water ASAP with the job of breaking ice for Brockville harbour.

<p>Kingston Marina reports having more boats for winter storage, and more boats for in-water winter storage, than ever before.   This picture show's the Anglin Bay harbour full of boats that are too big to be hauled out.  Theyare using agitators to keep the ice away.  The largest vessel being stored is the Canadian Empress at 108 ft.

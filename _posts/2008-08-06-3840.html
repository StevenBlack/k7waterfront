<p>The <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/WaterfrontPathwayBrochure2008.pdf" target="_blank">
"CITY OF KINGSTON 2008 WATERFRONT PATHWAY"</a>  is the subject of a <strong>pamphlet</strong> being distributed to tourists at all the usual places.

<p>"<strong>Kingston's Waterfront Pathway</strong>" is also the subject of a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/visitors/waterfrontpath/index.asp" target="_blank">
web page</a>  in the "Visitors" area of the City of Kingston Website.

<p><strong>Only two-thirds</strong> of the 9 (not 8) Km suggested by the brochure could actually be considered "on waterfront".

<p>Long stretches along King Street, with <strong>no water whatsoever in evidence</strong>, are part of the suggested "waterfront" pathway.

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/WaterfrontPathwayBrochure2008.pdf" target="_blank">
Look closely</a> : they suggest you <strong>walk around the K-Rock Centre</strong> as part of the waterfront tour.

<p>That's odd, because it <strong>steers walkers away</strong> from an exquisite stretch of our waterfront: the <strong>Lasalle Causeway</strong>, the <strong>RMC grounds</strong>, then <strong>Point Frederick</strong>, then <strong>Navy Bay</strong> and its very active boating facilities, <strong>Fort Henry</strong> of course, and then <strong>Point Henry</strong> all the way around behind the Fort. Then up and around for the <strong>best vista in town</strong>, from the very top of Fort Henry Hill.

<p><strong>Not a word about any of that</strong>.  A full 5 Km continuously by the water, <strong>including majestic elevated views of the city and the harbour</strong>.  All of it walkable and cycleable.  This is easily the longest uninterrupted "waterfront pathway" we've got.

<p><strong>But it merits no mention whatsoever in the City of Kingston tourist brochure about our walkable waterfront</strong>.

<p>They've printed some 14,000 copies over the past two years.  <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2008/PLN_A1008-SchedC.pdf" target="_blank">
Here's who's responsible</a>  for grossly misrepresenting our walkable waterfront to visitors.

<p><strong>Respect for waterfront means never, EVER selling it short</strong>.  In this town, in the Harvey Rosen era, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">disrespect
for our waterfront is rampant</a>.

<blockquote><b>Milton Island</b> is located in the St Lawrence River about two miles east of Cedar Island. The entrance to the Bateau Channel is between Milton Island and the nearby Spectacles shoal. Milton is part of the <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/on/lawren/index_e.asp">St Lawrence Islands National Park</a>, and Parks Canada maintains several docks, washrooms, campsites  and a picnic shelter at the cove on the eastern side of the island. Be careful of the large rock just below the surface in the middle of the cove(!).
<p>The island is well forested with a perimeter path giving a good view of boat traffic on the river as well as the rugged shoreline - granite carpeted with colourful lichen. Red columbine is plentuful in the spring. You will occassionally see deer. The outer shoreline is free of hidden rocks and keelboats can approach the rocks quite closely.</p><br></blockquote>

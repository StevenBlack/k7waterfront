<p>OPEN GATE: Mike Hill, of the most excellent <a href="http://dolphinscubaclub.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">CFB Kingston
Dolphin Scuba Club blog</a>, reports:
<blockquote><p>Here's a rare view of the Henry looking North and towards the dry dock she is likely to make her home later this week.</p>

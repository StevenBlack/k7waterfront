<p><img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/IslandGrillMoorings.jpg" class="floatright image1px" alt="">NEW MOORING FIELD on the South side of Kingston Harbour, just off the <a href="http://www.wolfeislandgrill.com/" target="_blank">The Island Grill</a>  on Wolfe Island, just East of the Wolfe Island Ferry dock.

<p>A total of 10 moorings, available free for now, though the plan is to eventually charge overnight, monthly, or yearly rates.

<p>Outer moorings have a depth of 14 feet, shallowing to 7ft for the inner ones.  No reservations are currently required.

<p>See also our <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/IslandGrill" target="_blank">Island Grill
topic</a>, and the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Anchor" target="_blank">Anchoring</a>  topic, still a work in progress, is updated to reflect these new moorings.

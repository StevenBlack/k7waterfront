<p>BEACH INFORMATION WHERE?  Wondering if a particular <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Beaches" target="_blank">local beach</a>  is open or closed?  The <a href="http://www.healthunit.on.ca" target="_blank">KFL&amp;A Health Unit
website</a>  is no help.  First you must guess that their <a href="whatsnew/dp.cfm?action=news" target="_blank">news page</a>  is where this information is kept, and then you must guess if a news item is current since their items are not dated.  What's worse, the beach information is buried in a narrative paragraph which must be interpreted, and some of the beach-closure related news items mention some beaches while omitting others.
<p>Searching for <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cgi-bin/citysearch.cgi?method=and&amp;config=htdig&amp;restrict=&amp;exclude=&amp;format=builtin-long&amp;words=beaches&amp;Search.x=0&amp;Search.y=0" target="_blank">
"Beaches"</a>  or <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cgi-bin/citysearch.cgi?method=and&amp;config=htdig&amp;restrict=&amp;exclude=&amp;format=builtin-long&amp;words=Beach+closing&amp;Search.x=0&amp;Search.y=0" target="_blank">
"Beach Closing"</a>  on the City of Kingston website yields dysfunctional results.

<p>What this city needs is a web page that clearly shows us the status of all local beaches at a glance.

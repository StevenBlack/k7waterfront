<p><a href="http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=5815" target="_blank">OFFICER
OF THE ORDER OF CANADA</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  announced today for <strong>Ian Bruce</strong> of Dorval, QC.

<blockquote><p>For his contributions to the sport of sailing in Canada and abroad, notably for the design and development of high-performance crafts for young sailors.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>OC</strong> is the 2nd highest rank.  That's the same level among sportsmen as the likes of Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr, Steve Podborski, and Alex Bauman so this is a very big deal.

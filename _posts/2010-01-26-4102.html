<p><strong>BUD GORMELY</strong>, past chairman of CORK, is to be inducted into the <a href="http://www.kdshf.ca/index.cfm?page=newsItem&amp;id=32" title="Link to the HOF announcement" target="_blank">Kingston District Sports Hall
of Fame</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  later this Spring.

<p>Quoting from the story in <a href="http://www.emckingston.ca/20100121/Sports/Kingston%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20rolls%20out%20welcome%20mat%20for%20five%20new%20members" title="Link to the Kingston EMC article about the HOF announcement" target="_blank">

<blockquote>
<p>Marsha Gormley was happy to hear that her husband Russell "Bud" Gormley had been inducted into the Hall of Fame. She just wished that he could have been there to enjoy the honour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Indeed.</strong> This honour is probably 20-years overdue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bud Gormley is remembered as a pioneer of the Canadian Olympic Regatta Kingston (CORK). During the 1976 Olympic Games, Gormley was known as the unofficial mayor of the Olympic Village at the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour. He was a key organizer of many other international sailing events in Kingston. Later in his life, Gormley carried out several humanitarian missions in the Dominican Republic.</p>

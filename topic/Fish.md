##General overview

> **Some 85 fish species** have been recorded in Lake Ontario.

> A number of once common species are now no longer found in the lake, including the deepwater sculpin (once so numerous they were considered a nuisance), blue walleye, bridle shiner, kiyi and blackfin cisco.

> Though still present, **lake trout** and **lake whitefish** are no longer very common. At present the most abundant native species include **yellow and brown bullhead**, **American eel**, **northern pike**, **yellow perch**, **walleye**, **sauger**, **smallmouth** and **largemouth bass**.

> Various species of amphibians and reptiles are common in wetland areas. Although ring-billed gulls dominate the water bird fauna of this region by a wide margin, there are also small colonies of herring gulls, double-crested cormorants, Caspian and and common terns, great blue herons and black-crowned night herons. Significant numbers of waterfowl -- Canada geese, black ducks, mallards, canvasbacks, redheads and scaups -- stage in the region both in spring and fall. Numerous birds winter where open water permits, mainly gulls and various ducks.

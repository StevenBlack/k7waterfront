HENRY ALLOWED TO MOVE</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  The permission process took <i>way</i> too long.

<p><b>Updated</b>:  The move into the dry dock now looks to probably happen <strong>FRIDAY</strong> June 15th starting at 5:00 AM.  Call the Museum at (613) 542-2261 to offer help.

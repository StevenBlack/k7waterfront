<p>A good thing:  Kingston Yacht Club is running a <a href="http://kingstonyachtclub.com/lts/boat_loan.cfm" target="_blank">BOAT LOAN
PROGRAM</a>.

<p>The KYC Junior Sailing program has a limited number of boats for racing-level kids who do not have their own boat.

<p>Do you have a Laser gathering dust in your garage, or hiding under your deck?  Do you have an Optimist that your kids no longer use?  If so, and if you would be willing to loan, charter or otherwise make it available to our Junior Sailing kids, then please contact <a href="mailto:lts@kingstonyachtclub.com" target="_blank">Chris Walmsley at
lts@kingstonyachtclub.com</a>.

<p>This sounds like something worth supporting.

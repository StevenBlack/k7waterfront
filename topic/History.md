<blockquote><b><u>How Deadman's Bay Got Its Name</u>

<p>In 1847, during construction of the Martello Tower on Cedar Island - "Cathcart Redoubt", a group of 23 workers were returning home from Cedar Island.  A heavy swell caused the overloaded boat to capsize. Two swam to safety. Another four survived by clinging to the overturned boat. But 17 died. As a result of this, Hamilton Cove, between Cedar Island and Point Henry was renamed <i>Deadman's Bay.</b></i></p></blockquote>

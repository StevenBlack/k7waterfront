<p>It's about an <em>Official Plan Amendment</em>, a <em>Zoning Bylaw Amendment</em> and <em>Draft Plan of Subdivision</em> for <strong>Baxter Farm Subdivision</strong> on Hwy 15.

<p>The western edge of this proposed subdivision would approach the Cataraqui River.

<p>What's hilarious is the degree to which our country-bumpkin' politicians, staff, and some other morons are so conveniently, or so easily, <strong>UNESCOed</strong>.

MILINA OUTLOOK POINT</a>  is the newest and possibly tinyest of Kingston's <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Parks" target="_blank">waterfront parks</a>.

<p>It sits on the southeastern edge of Portsmouth Olympic Harbour on land formerly controlled by Corrections Canada.  It was opened in June 2008.

<p>The point is also known as <strong>Hatters Bay Park</strong></p>

<p>The recently released consultant's report, titled <em>Kingston Marinas Sustainability and Development Strategy and Business Plan</em> says <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/recreation/marinas/Marinas_Development-BizPlanReport.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">
this</a>  about the <strong>the Coast Guard building</strong> that sits on the Western edge of the POH property.
<blockquote>
<p>Current Coast Guard building inadequate for their needs considering relocation to east side of harbour at Hadders (sic) Bay Park.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the plan's recommendations for POH is <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/recreation/marinas/Marinas_Development-BizPlanReport.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">
number 7</a> :
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommendation POH7</strong> : Collaborate with the Coast Guard to <strong>develop and implement a plan</strong> for
relocating and enlarging their land-based facilities and berth, while <strong>relocating
Hatters Bay Park to current Coast Guard location</strong> at southwest corner of site.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Implications</strong>: <span class="highlight">Minimal or no cost to City of Kingston</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Timing</strong>: Q4 2008- Q2 2009 (sic)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understandably, <strong>clobbering a beautiful waterfront park</strong> and moving it to a concrete-surrounded petrol-station-sign-dominated place in the shadow of tall condo buildings has folks in <a href="http://www.mckendry.net/PORTSMOUTH/Portsmouth_Village.htm" target="_blank">Portsmouth
Village</a>  a little disturbed.

<p><strong>But more to the point</strong>, according to the consultant, all this is supposed to happen at <em><strong>minimal or no cost to City of Kingston</strong></em>.
<ul>
<li> Build a new house-sized structure, and running services to it,
<li> build a parking lot at the new structure,
<li> build substantial new berths for coast guard vessels on the East-side of POH,
<li> pave and perpetually clear and maintain the road to the new structure,
<li> demolish a smaller but still house-sized structure, and rip-up the extisting Coast Guard area and turn that into a "park".
</ul>

<p><strong>Right!</strong>

<p>It's a really stupid idea <strong>on so many levels</strong>.  Still, it's out-there, floating-around as someone's bright idea for our waterfront.

<p>Nevermind that there's <strong>no other publicly accessible waterfront</strong> between there and Breakwater Park, a full 1.2 kilometers to the east, as the crow flies.

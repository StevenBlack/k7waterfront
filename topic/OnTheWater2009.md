##Misrepresenting Kingston waterfront
You're looking at the last page of the ****Spring and Summer 2009 City of Kingston Recreation and Leisure Magazine****.

This full-page ad purports to showcase some great things "On the Water", therefore supposedly related to some degree to our waterfront.

**Bullshit!**

The items circled, the Kingston Buskers Rendezvous, and the Limestone City Blues Festival, nave **'NOTHING**' whatsoever to do with our waterfront.

In fact, if you go to these events, you'll be greeted by the [http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront](locked gates of Confederation Basin Marina).

**Who is well-served by misleading residents and visitors about our waterfront?**

Look at the list as a whole.  How many of these events are about getting people in, or on, the water?

**Just two**.
<ol>
<li>At the [http://collinsbaymarina.com/SafeBoating.html](Don't Rock The Boat) event at Collins Bay Marina (which is really great) you can try canoes and kayaks, and you can take a ride in a powerboat.  Lots of other things too. </li>

<li>At the Kingston Kids Perch Fishing Derby at POH you and your kids will be on a dock with a fishing rod in-hand.</li>
</ol>

None of those two water-accessiblity focused events is near downtown.

Everything else is athletes, dragon boat teams, or out-of-town power-boaters only.

That sums-up our so-called "wonderful waterfront".  **It's pathetic**, to be brutally honest.

Kingston's waterfront resource is, if anything, **a spectacular underachievement**.

**Related**:  KEDCO's grossly misleading (and ultimately botched) [http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews012008.html#3687](waterfront promotion website).

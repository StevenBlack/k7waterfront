LAKES ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY STUDY</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  has just been released, and it's fascinating reading.

<p>The <a href="http://www.glsls-study.com/Supporting%20documents/GLSLS%20finalreport%20Fall%202007.pdf" target="_blank">
128-page PDF</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is full of interesting discussion and schematics on the economic importance of the Seaway, environmental considerations, infrastructure, and various aspects and challenges of keeping the Seaway in operation.

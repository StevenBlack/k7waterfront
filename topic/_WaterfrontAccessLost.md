##Access Lost

<div class="halfbox">
<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/ConfedAccess100h.jpg" class="floatright" title="Disgraceful blocked public access to the town docks">
<h3>Locked gates at Confederation Basin<br>(since 2006)</h3>
The City of Kingston town docks are <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Disgraces">off-limits</a> to everyone, residents and visitors alike, except for boaters parked there.

Denied to <a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3061018">everybody</a> by disconnected desk-flying bureaucrats at City Hall, in Ottawa, and elsewhere.

Which [[http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20070810 keeps visitors off the hill]], and away from the water.  Go straight to the giftshop. One of the finest water vistas in Canada is not for you.  Because we arbitrarily say so.

Once used by <a href="http://dolphinscubaclub.blogspot.ca/search/label/Tett%20Centre">local divers</a> for shore-dives to nearby wrecks, and all-essential proximate parking for gear.  This site is now evidently lost forever for shore diving.

<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/images/DND-BikeTrailClosed100h.jpg" alt="DND Trail is closed" class="floatright" title="Wouldn't want anybody enjoying a lovely natural waterfront trail"><h3>Closed trail through the DND-owned woodlands (since 2006 (?))</h3>
An interesting natural walking and bike trail that's adjacent or within view of the water over significant distance.

A favorite downtown fishing spot is [[http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20070813 closed by officious desk-flying knobs]].

<div class="halfbox">
<h3>Anchoring prohibited inside Confederation Basin  (since 2005 (?))</h3>
Though there's plenty of room for moorings, there are none.  Furthermore, since about 2005, anchoring isn't permitted behind the breakwall.  Boating to Kingston?  ''Tight, noisy docks only''.

Used by <a href="http://dolphinscubaclub.blogspot.com/2007/05/logging-dive-at-marine-museum.html">local divers</a> for shore-dives to nearby wrecks, and parking. Currently closed for repairs. This now looks like a permanent loss of access for local shore diving.

Lost are <strong>some 200m of dockable seawall</strong> in Confederation Basin. <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/planning/blockd/BlockDPark_Phase1.pdf">What was built</a> is a tumblestone block finish, the minimum-cost option for Homestead Land Holdings.

MORE MARINA SHENANEGANS IN THE CITY:

For Information (RFI) No. CS-AM-2006-02</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  on the future of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ConfederationBasin" target="_blank">Confederation

here</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  to see the interesting and detailed documents submitted to Council to approve this move in late March, 2006.
<p>Various questions arise from all this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why hasn't this document been widely circulated?  It was advertised once in Kingston This Week.  Pick-up only from the Midland St office.  It was never publicly posted online by the City.  Was a notice of this forwarded to, say, the <a href="http://www.marinasontario.com/" target="_blank">Ontario Marina Operators
Association</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> ?  Were <a href="http://www.bellingham-marine.com/" target="_blank">players</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  from the wider marina industry approached?  Why such a short leash?
<p>
<li>What is the linkage between this RFI and the Request For Proposals, which apparently would soon follow?  Why the rush?  The RFI packs onerous production requirements into a short time, and reserves all rights to plans and intellectual property conveyed by respondents.  The period for questions, for example, has already expired, just three weeks into this.
<p>
<li>What's in place to protect taxpayers, protect access for boating residents and events, and for equitable treatment for other local waterfront-related interests, both commercial and public?
<p>
<li>Why does all this appear to not pass a basic stink-test?   <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews042006.html#2971" target="_blank">
Last April, for example</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, the <a href="http://beerblog.genx40.com/archives/2005/january/kingstonbrewing" target="_blank">
The Kingston Brewing Company</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  was precipitously given the task of <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2006/A09_Rpt45.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">
running #6 Clarence Street</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, which is now the marina office, in what was the restaurant  nearest  to Confederation Basin.
</ul>
What next?

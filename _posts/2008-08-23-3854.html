LAKES MISS THE BOAT</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, according to the Saturday Ottawa Citizen.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Area has everything except a visible attempt to promote itself</strong></p>
<p>This area between Smiths Falls and Kingston has lakes of all sizes, the Rideau Canal, the Cataraqui Trail, fine fishing, decent golf courses, excellent scenery and some quaint towns. What it doesn't have is any visible effort to promote or package all that attractive stuff. </p></blockquote>

<p>That's so true.

<a href="http://www.twprideaulakes.on.ca/index.html" target="_blank">The Township
of Rideau Lakes</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is an independent entity and, if the author is correct, then <strong>tourism-wise Kingston has an evidently weak northern neighbor</strong> with tons of potential.</p>

<p>Just like Quebec City benefits from Mt. Ste-Anne, and Montreal benefits from the Eastern Townships, <strong>Kingston stands to gain from having stronger tourism players in the region</strong>.</p>

<p>Not that Kingston currently contributes much regionally.  Currently, Kingston's tourism "region", its sole focus, covers barely a square-mile.</p>

<p>If Kingston can <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews082008.html#3840" target="_blank">
shake its myopia</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  and break free from <a href="http://www.downtownkingston.ca/" target="_blank">the cult of Downtown
Kingston</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, then maybe it could eventually help strengthen, and center, a vast and dynamic region. </p>

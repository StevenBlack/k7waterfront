<p><strong>BILL STEENBAKKERS, a Kingston waterfront pioneer</strong> who passed-away earlier this month, was the subject of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig1972-CollinsBayMarina" title="Link to a scan of the article" target="_blank">a 1972 Kingston Whig-Standard
article</a>  about the founding of <a href="http://collinsbaymarina.com/" title="Link to the Collins Bay Marina website" target="_blank">Collins Bay
Marina.</a>

<p>Reading the article, evidently Bill Steenbakkers' original vision for the marina remains intact nearly forty years later.

<p>The suceess of Collins Bay Marina was never assured -- it's interesting that <strong>there were already two other marinas on the Bay</strong> when Collins Bay Marina was built.

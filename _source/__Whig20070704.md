John Gerretsen, MPP for Kingston and the Islands, announced Tuesday that the provincial government will contribute $80,000 to help the city host the 37th [[www.youthworlds2007.org Volvo Youth Sailing ISAF World Championship]].

The regatta will be held at [[Portsmouth Olympic Harbour]] from July 12 to 21.

The money, granted under the guidelines of the [[www.mhp.gov.on.ca/english/sportandrec/hostingpolicy/hostingpolicy-EN.pdf Ontario International Amateur Sport Hosting Policy]], is intended to support both the athletic and economic benefit Kingston residents will gain from hosting this event. The provincial government hopes the event will help tourism in Kingston as well as support amateur sport in the city.

Fifty countries are signed up to compete in this year’s event featuring sailors aged 18 years of age and younger.

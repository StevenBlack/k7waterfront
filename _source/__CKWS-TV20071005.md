IT'S OVER 12 METERS LONG, AND 4 METERS HIGH.

AND IT'S THE NEWEST PIECE OF THE EQUIPMENT FOR THE KINGSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT.

THIS IS "MARINE ONE" -- DUBBED THE CITY'S BIGGEST FIRE HYDRANT.

AFTER MONTHS OF WORK, THE RETIRED COAST GUARD CUTTER HAS BEEN REFITTED INTO A FIRE FIGHTING BOAT -- AT A COST OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

THE 13 TONNE FIRE AND RESCUE BOAT IS ON PUBLIC DISPLAY AT "METALCRAFT MARINE" -- THE COMPANY THAT DID THE REFIT AND TESTING.

WHEN IT'S COMMISSIONED NEXT SPRING, "MARINE ONE" WILL GIVE FIRE FIGHTERS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO FIRES ON THE WATER, AND ALONG THE SHORE.- RANDY MOORE, ASSISTANT FIRE CHIEF:

"WE CAN PUMP THREE THOUSAND GALLONS A MINUTE MINIMUM. AND WE CAN SUPPLY SOME FIRE TRUCKS WITH THAT. OR WE CAN FIGHT ON BOARD SHIP FIRES. IT'S FREE WATER WHEN HE HAVE IT PUMP INTO THE TRUCKS, SO THERE'S NO COST TO SUPPLY THE VEHICLES. WE CAN SUPPLY MORE WATER THAN THE TRUCKS CAN ACTUALLY USE AT A SCENE. AND WE CAN STILL DO SEARCH AND RESCUE CAPABILITIES WHEN CALLED UPON. WE CAN DO ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSES."THE BOAT'S 3 POWERFUL NOZZLES CAN PUMP 3-THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER A MINUTE ONTO FIRES.

IT'LL COST ABOUT 10-THOUSAND A YEAR TO OPERATE.

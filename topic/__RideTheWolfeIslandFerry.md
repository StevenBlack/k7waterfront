<h3> Ride the [[Wolfe Island Ferry]]</h3><a href="http://K7Waterfront.org/Topic/WolfeIslandFerry"><img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/WolfeIslandFerryHighwayMap.jpg" class="floatright image1px"></a>
<ul>
<li> See our [[Wolfe Island Ferry]] page.
<li> The Wolfe Island Ferry is free for cars and pedestrians.  You may leave the car in the (free) ferry park lot on the Kingston-side because you can do a lot on foot upon arrival in Marysville.
<li> It's about a 20-minute ride each way.
<li> It's a great crossing, leaning on the railing on the upper deck.
<li> Bring a sweater if it's windy. A hat and sunglasses are a good idea too!
<li> See Kingston Harbour, Fort Henry, Cedar Island, the Alexander Henry in the Marine Museum drydock, and others.
<li> Come right back, or catch the following ferry back about an hour later.
<li> Option: explore Marysville, located right at the (summer) ferry dock, visit its general store, or have an ice cream cone, or stop for a meal at the [[Island Grill]].
<li> Option: <a href="http://www.wolfeisland.com/mtarchives/000137.php">Wolfe Island Bicycle Routes</a>
<li> All told, this is a  great way to get on water and see the waterfront.
<li> All this (except for food and souvenirs) is free.
</ul>

<h1>Waterfront-related politics in the Kingston area</h1>

<div class="item">

I note a rather astonishing quote on CKWS from Mark Mattison of <i> Ontario Waterkeeper</i> regarding the proposed burning of tires and scrap plastic at the Lafarge Cement plant in Bath.

    <p>"THIS IS ABOUT STANDING UP FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS ABOUT STANDING UP FOR FISH AND PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND FOR YOUR CLEAN AIR AND FOR THE FUTURE OF THE KINGSTON COMMUNITY WHO REALLY IS THE DOWN WINDERS OF THIS PROJECT"

   MATTSON SAYS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD RATHER SEE ELECTRICITY BEING PRODUCED FROM TIRES, PLASTIC AND
GARBAGE.HE SAYS IT'S JUST A WAY FOR LAFARGE TO INCREASE PROFITS.

THE COMPANY ADMITS IF THE PLAN GETS GOVERNMENT APPROVAL THE 8 MILLION DOLLAR COST OF EQUIPMENT WILL BE RECOVERED BY LAFARGE OVER 4 YEARS.

<p>Wow!

<p>In the first place, if its "OK" to burn tires in a power plant, what precisely is "not OK" about burning tires in a cement plant?

<p> In the second place, what - precisely -  is wrong with making money? Why must companies "admit" that they are being competitive in a fiercely competitive global economy? Does Mr Mattison not realize that corporate profits are the 'engine' that drives the Canadian economy?

<p>As  an <i>admittedly</i> small shareholder in a number of Canadian companies, I am comforted by capital growth and secure dividends. Comforted in the same way as millions of other Canadian small investors and benificiaries of RRSP's, government and company pensions and of course, the beloved Canada Pension.

<p>There is indeed merit - great merit -  in the rigorous examination of all proposals potentially affecting our environment. But there is utterly no merit in Mr Mattison's strident - and somewhat self righteous- rhetoric. Stay on message, Mark. Thinking, responsible people might start listening to you. Which, by the way, is what you want - isn't it?

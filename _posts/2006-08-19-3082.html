LYME DISEASE TICS HAVE ARRIVED</a> : Tics carrying <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/Lymedisease.pdf" target="_blank">Lyme
disease</a>  have established a presence on <a href="http://www.paddle1000.com/books/route4.pdf#search=%22Thwartway%20Island%22" target="_blank">
Thwartway Island</a>, also know as Leek Island.
<p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentID=163281&amp;catname=Local+News" target="_blank">

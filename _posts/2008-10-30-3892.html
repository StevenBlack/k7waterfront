AT COUNCIL</a>  this upcoming Tuesday, two related items about <strong>Crawford Wharf</strong>.  Coincidence?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2008/A22_Rpt120.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">
$130,000 request for overdue maintenance of Crawford Wharf</a>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.burnettthorneculturaltourism.com/contactus.html" target="_blank">A
Kingston-based promoter</a>  is seeking <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2008/A22_InfoRpt.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">
support from Council</a>  for Kingston to become a 2009 port of call for <a href="http://pearlseascruises.com/store.php?crn=229" target="_blank">Pearl Seas
Cruises</a>  and their 335-foot cruise ship <a href="http://www.greatlakescruising.com/pearl-mist/" target="_blank"><em>Pearl
Mist</em></a>  using, you guessed it, Crawford Wharf.
</li>
</ul>

<p>But,
<blockquote>
<p>In real terms most cruise ships would start off by including Kingston as a port-of-call with a <em>brief stay of several hours</em>
in port. This would offer the downtown merchants an opportunity to sell their wares and nearby and mid-distance
attractions to be included in shore excursions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore this is for quickies, the 200 passengers being roughly equivalent to just three busloads, a few times per year, for a few hours each time.

<p>How Crawford Wharf <strong>trumps other deferred maintenance in Kingston</strong>, nevermind just waterfront-related deferred maintenance, is anybody's guess.

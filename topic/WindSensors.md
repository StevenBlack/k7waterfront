<h3>Environment Canada / Kingston Airport</h3>
<a href="http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/city/pages/on-69_metric_e.html"><img class="floatleft" border="0" src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/AirportGraph.jpg"></a>
The <a href="http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/city/pages/on-69_metric_e.html">Current Conditions for Kingston from Environment Canada</a> page provides current conditions at the airport.  From there you can access pages about <a href="http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/trends_table/pages/ygk_metric_e.html">past 24-hours conditions</a> (coarse direction and average velocity) in table form, and also a <a href="http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/forecast/trends_graph_e.html?ygk&unit=m">24 hour trends graphs</a> that show wind velocity but not direction.
<p>The Environment Canada wind sensor is reliable for all wind directions, but note that the Kingston airport is inland somewhat, just outside the prevailing-wind "funnel" that is Kingston harbour, and is less prone to sea breezes than is Kingston Harbour, though <i>occasionally</i> the airport will sense the <a href="http://marine.rutgers.edu/cool/seabreeze/tutorial.html">seabreeze front</a> before the harbour does.  Beware that sometimes the airport sees entirely different wind from that felt in Kingston Harbour.
<p>The Environment Canada sensor gives little or no sense of the range of breeze shiftiness.

<h3>iWindsurf.com</h3>

The iWindsurf.com wind sensor is mounted at the end of the pier of the Kingston Yacht Club, immediately East of McDonald park. The sensor has a clear view of the wind for all cross and onshore conditions from Norhteast through South to West.

The iWindsurf.com website provides the basic wind velocity and direction plot for free, and subscribers get access to a variety of other weater forecasts and services.
<b>BEWARE</b>: This sensor is reliable only for winds from the Southern sector.
<b>BEWARE</b>: This sensor does not report data collected between 8 pm and 6 am.

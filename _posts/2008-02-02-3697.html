<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the application is to allow the adjustment of property boundaries with the effect of reducing the number of lots
from 37 lots to 14 parcels in order to recognize the location of homes, water wells, septic systems and vehicle paths. Lots are
being merged, lot lines are being adjusted and rights-of-way are being created. No new homes or building lots are being
created. However, the legal descriptions of the properties will result in a form that is suitable for convenient conveyance.

<p>That's really sweet waterfront, right there.

<p>There's a sweetner involved, though why it's there isn't mentioned.  Moreover its location isn't marked in the exhibits.

<blockquote>
<p>The Owner also proposes to donate a parcel of land to the City in order to allow access to the shore line of Deadman's
Bay. The site is acceptable to the Parks Department.

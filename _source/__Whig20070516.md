The skyline along Elevator Bay in the west end will be lined with three more buildings under plans to be unveiled tonight. That's when a Toronto-based developer will give the public a first look at its plans for the pier on Elevator Bay, off King Street just west of Lake Ontario Park.

The proposed development has a combined value of approximately $160 million. If built, it would end decades of failed development on the pier.

"Everybody on this property knew this was going to happen," said Hans Vorster, president of the condominium association for Commodore's Cove, which sits at the mouth of the pier.

"It may not make everybody happy that it will happen, but at least we weren't taken by surprise."

The Forrest Group proposes three buildings: a nine-storey, 154-suite retirement residence run by Amica Mature Lifestyles Inc.
; an associated apartment building that will have apartment-style or bachelor suites; and a condominium building at the edge of the pier. "We're not just rushing up," said Ric Knutson, director of development for the Forrest Group. "We've done a fair bit of work to get to this point."

The associated apartment building would be for seniors, while the condominiums would be for the general public, Knutson said.

Construction on the retirement residence is to begin in the fall with the opening next summer. Six months to a year after that, the condominium building would be completed.

Once both buildings are completed, the seniors' residence, with 120 units, would be built, Knutson said.

The Forrest Group also plans to build a geothermal energy plant to provide heating and cooling for the site and for the accompanying roads "to keep winter salt out of the bay," Knutson said. Researchers at Queen's University will help.

Developments on Elevator Bay have been on the books for years. City planning director George Wallace said the site is approved for up to 343 units and a 10,000 sq.-ft. marina.

"There's a fair chunk of development potential that's been approved for that property," he said.

The Forrest Group has asked the city for a zoning change to allow for a retirement residence on the land. Currently, the land is zoned for residential development, Wallace said.

Knutson said there is no design yet for the marina, but past designs won't be used.

"The marina design approved years ago isn't going to fly for a whole bunch of reasons," he said.

The pier itself is a "bit of a wasteland," Vorster said.

Vorster said local residents walk around the seawall on the pier; others let their dogs roam off-leash. There's also a vegetable garden near the edge of the pier and compost bins, he said.

"It's a quiet spot," he said.

The developer is looking at ways of mitigating noise from the construction, Knutson said. "There's no question we're going to have a very disruptive influence in their lives," Knutson said.

Vorster said condominium complex residents will hold their annual general meeting tomorrow, at which time the development will be discussed.

Public meeting

A public meeting will be held about the proposed development at Elevator Bay tonight from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the dining room at the Cataraqui Golf and Country Club.

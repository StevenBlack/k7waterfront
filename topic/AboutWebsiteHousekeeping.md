Gracious [[Contributors]] keep this wiki neat. You can too!

<font size=+1>Some reasons to edit wiki pages:</font>
Here are typical little messes that are hard to avoid but easy to take care of. Do it, and help make this wiki more valuable.
<ul>
<li><b>Authors Can't Spell</b>. Gentle housekeepers make the necessary adjustments to spelling and grammar without otherwise drawing attention to modest mistakes.

<li><b>Summarizing</b>. As topics grow, they benefit from the attention of insightful housekeepers who squeeze nuggets out of topics.

<li><b>Correcting</b>. Hey, it's a big world.  Nobody can possibly know everything.  A knowledgeable housekeeper will carefully and respectfully edit things s/he knows <i>for a fact</i> are incorrect. Thoughtful topic authors should not take this personally, and should be thankful that if a mistake is made the community is there to patch it and make it right.

<li><b>Refactoring</b>. As topics grow, they often become unwieldy, so industrious housekeepers will organize the topic, break it into subtopics, and sometimes replace chunks of text with links to places where issues are best (or already) covered.

<li><b>Enhancing quickies</b>. Some pages contain only a URL. An enterprising housekeeper follows the link, explores, and puts a sentence or two in the originating topic explaining why someone else might want to follow the link.

<li><b>Take something back</b>. The beauty of the wiki is anybody can add anything to any topic, or take it back. The wiki isn't a real-time medium. People have time to think, sometimes for days or weeks, before they follow up on some wiki topics. What people write is often, upon reconsideration, vastly improved.

<li><b>Pages Are Accidentally Added</b>, so industrious housekeepers delete the pages to clean up the database and keep the site in order.
</ul>

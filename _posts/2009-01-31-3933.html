DEVELOPER DONATES $200,000 TO THE MARINE MUSEUM</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  in today's Whig.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> apparently the Whig muffed the headline and the first paragraph of the story. The money isn't donated to the museum, it's earmarked for upgrading the dock, which is federally-owned.

<p>COAST GUARD STATION RELOCATION is still a threat, according to the Fall 2010 <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/PDCA-NLFall2010.pdf#page=5" title="Link to the Fall 2010 PCDA newsletter" target="_blank">Portsmouth Community
Newsletter</a> </p>

<p>There's <strong>a whiff of arrogance from the feds here</strong>.  <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/AnneMilinaOutlookPoint" title="Link to the K7 article on Anne Milina Park" target="_blank">Anne Milina
Park</a>, on the water, is definitely threatened.<p>

<blockquote>
<p>PDCA has been disappointed that the Coast Guard (Department of Fisheries and Oceans-DFO) has shown no interest in discussing the matter with municipal representatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As citizens, we might want to consider working to kaibosh the whole relocation plan.

PRESSURE CHANGES NEAR WIND TURBINE BLADES</a>  injures bat lungs, according to a recent University of Calgary study.

<blockquote><p>A bat mortality study supervised by U of C biology professor Robert Barclay that began in 2006 has determined that the vast majority of bats found dead below turbines near Pincher Creek suffered severe injuries to their respiratory systems consistent with a sudden drop in air pressure -- called <strong>barotrauma</strong> -- that occurs when the animals get close to turbine blades...</p>

<p>The study shows that 90 per cent the bats examined after death showed signs of internal hemorrhaging consistent with barotraumas while only about half of the bats showed any evidence of direct contact with the blades.</p></blockquote>

<p>So wind turbines are deadlier to flying animals than just the trauma of contact with the blades.  Flying close to a blade can kill too.

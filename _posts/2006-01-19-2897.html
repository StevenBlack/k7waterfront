Apparently the city feels that a <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/LakeOntarioPark" target="_blank">Lake
Ontario Park</a>  "Visioning and Revitalization" exercise should start with a <a href="" target="_blank">call for stories and photos documenting citizens' use of
the lakeside fun spot</a>.
<p>This is now happening <i>after</i> they <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/parks/park_lakeont_closing.asp" target="_blank">
closed</a>  the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/parks/park_lakeont.asp" target="_blank">
campground</a>  and all but chased away <a href="http://www.funworldpark.com/drivein.html" target="_blank">Kingston Family
Funworld</a>  from the site.
<p>We assume they aren't interested in photos and memories of camping on Kingston's waterfront, or about family times spent on rides at Lake Ontario Park.

<blockquote><b>Prinyer's Cove</b>, near the Upper Gap, is a favourite stopover and destination for cruisers. It offers good, deep holding and shelter from all but north east winds. A small marina next to the green Quonset hut has washrooms, laundry facilities and a pump out. The marina also rents mooring balls by the night. The walk along the road toward the fish plant near Indian Point is very pleasant.<br>

Prinyers Cove is most widely known as a stopover for bootleggers during Prohibition. Here, rum runners would wait for cargos coming down from Belleville, or for favourable weather prior to crossing Lake Ontario or making a run to Main Duck.<br>

The cove was also where the steam barge <i>Norman</i> burned on the night of Dec 2 1883. The fire broke out about 11 p.m. while the crew were asleep. It happened fast. They had just time to save themselves by jumping overboard. The crew lost everything, including their clothing. <br>

While the Prinyers Cove is named after John Prinyer, an later settler, it was first named 'Grog Bay' and later 'Macdonnell Cove' after the Scottish chief who settled there after the American Revolution. <br></blockquote>

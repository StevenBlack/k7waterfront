The **[http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/development/wellington/index.asp](Wellington Street Extension)** will be like laying Taylor Kidd Blvd through this waterfront park.

<h3>Rideau Marina</h3>
<img src="http://k7Waterfront.org/Images/RideauMarina2012-135.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Rideau Marina, deserted" />
Owned by **Homestead Land Holdings**, the region's most aggressive property developer.  Until recently Rideau Marina was the only remaining marina in Kingston with on-site marine service. Today it lies mostly fallow, abandoned by one of the richest corporations in Eastern Ontario.


<h3>Music Marina</h3>
Likely to be **obliterated by the third-crossing** of the Cataraqui River.

Music marina isn't big but it's **the only place in North Kingston with access to water** for launching or docking.


<h3>Probable: fences at Kingston's main wharves</h3>
May be coming as part of **homeland security** measures.

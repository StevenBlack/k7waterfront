##Patient Perchers
by Tim Gordanier

Naomi, 2, left, and her sister Tessa Owen, 5, practice patience while waiting for the fish to bite in the annual Kids Perch Derby at Portsmouth Olympic Harbour on Saturday. More than 700 children were expected to take part in the event hosted by the Kingston District Rod and Gun Club and the Kingston Police Association. Children 12 and under were allowed to fish for free, and an assortment of perch, sunfish, rock bass and goby were hauled in during the four-hour event.

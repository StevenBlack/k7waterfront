<p><strong>BRACE YOURSELF:</strong>  Waterfront accessibility appears to take significant importance in the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2010/PLN_A1410-10066.pdf" title="Link to the Planning Committee report" target="_blank">Application for
Zoning Bylaw Amendment</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  for the Tett Centre which is on the Cily's Planning Committee agenda for tonight, August 5th.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no mention of accessibility for SCUBA diving, given that the Tett Centre property has been used for years to access <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews032009.html#3958" title="Link to a related K7 news item from March 2009" target="_blank">one of
Kingston's best shore dives</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

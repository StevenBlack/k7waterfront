<p>As you might expect given recent rains, LAKE ONTARIO WATER LEVELS are up sharply.<p>

<p>The latest <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" title="Link to the US Army Corps of Engineers report on Great Lakes water levels." target="_blank">
WATER LEVEL REPORT</a>  now shows insight into <strong>what to expect throughout the Summer</strong>: slightly higher levels than last year, and slightly higher than <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews122010.html#4225" target="_blank">
last December's forecast</a>, but still about <strong>5" below long-term averages</strong>.</p>

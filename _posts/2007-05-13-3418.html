A MARINE MUSEUM PURCHASE STATUS REPORT</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  will be presented at Tuesday's Council meeting.  The recommendation asks for $195,000 in funding for engineering investigations into the west wharf, east wharf and drydock structures.
<p>There's much more in the report, including this ballpark estimate:
<blockquote><p>
In the next 2 to 10 years, it is estimated that over $6,000,000 must be spent on remedial works to reinstate the following marine structures back to a serviceable condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete rehabilitation of the west wharf
<li>Reconstruction of the upper section of wall around the perimeter of the drydock extension
<li>Rehabilitation of the east wharf
<li>Possible rehabilitation of the limestone block section of the drydock.
</ul>
<p>This estimated cost does not include contingency, contract administration, inspection, environmental, etc.,
which could easily exceed an additional $2,500,000. None of these costs, totaling an estimated $8.5
million are budgeted in the City's ten year capital plan.

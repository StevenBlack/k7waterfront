THE LATEST OFFICIAL PLAN</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  for the City of Kingston contains much related to waterfront in its <strong>35 PDF documents and hundreds of pages</strong>.

<p>We're fast approaching the plan's <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/development/officialplan/consultation.asp" target="_blank">
"consultation"</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  period, for what that's worth.

<p>Looking through all the documents for its waterfront-related aspects, <strong>there are numerous general mentions of the recreational uses of our waterfront</strong>.  Considering the vast majority of kingstonians have no meaningful relationship with the waterfront beyond the occasional glimpse, <strong>it all rings hollow</strong>.

<p>The plan <strong>goes nowhere beyond cliches and platitudes as far as recreational waterfront is concerned</strong>.

<p>For example, in the hundreds of pages of the plan, <strong>the words <em>Swim</em>, <em>Sail</em>, <em>Row</em> or <em>Rowing</em>, <em>SCUBA</em>, or <em>Diving</em> never appear</strong>.  The word <em>Wreck</em> appears several times, always in reference to wrecking yards.

<p><strong>The word <em>Beach</em> appears just once</strong> in reference to Richardson Beach Bathouse but not in the context of swimming, its renovation, or any recreational aspect you might hope-for.

<p>Don't look to the plan for mention of <em>Ramps</em> unless those ramps are for sidewalk accessibility.

<p>The word <em>Fishing</em> appears once, in the context of some policy that would control fish farming -- probably text copied wholesale from some other municipality's plan.

<p>The word <em>Boating</em> is used once, in a non-specific way, in one document titled "<a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/planning/officialplan/OP-FallDraft_Section10A.pdf" target="_blank">
Downtown and Harbour Area Special Policy Area</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> ".

<p>In that PDF you'll find <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/planning/officialplan/OP-FallDraft_Section10A.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">
doozies like this</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype"> :
<blockquote>
<p>Public Access to the Water<br>
<strong>10A.4.14.</strong> Access to the waterfront will be enhanced wherever possible, particularly at the ends of public rights of way. <strong>Publicly accessible docks also form character-defining elements of the Harbour Area and provide informal open space that will be preserved.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Disgraces" target="_blank">Bullshit!</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">

<p>Oh, there are good things in the plan.  Lots of words about <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/planning/officialplan/OP-FallDraft_Schedule5.pdf" target="_blank">
linking waterfront pathways</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, and acquiring waterfront properties.  But everybody knows there will never be much money for that.

<p>You can have a multi-faceted plan that makes everybody, especially its authors and the politicians, feel-good.  But in the end, when it comes to implementation, <strong>there is only one group in Kingston that ALWAYS hoovers most of the money: Downtown Kingston</strong>.  This plan ensures that this will continue.

<p>The plan is crystal clear on this: the systematic and grotesque annual subsidies of Downtown Kingston, the land owners there, and those who run the related tourist-trappings, will continue unabated.

<p>Looking for quality of life initiatives for the residents of the rest of amalgamated Kingston, especially addressing our waterfront-related recreational infrastructure deficit?  <strong>Not in the plan</strong>.

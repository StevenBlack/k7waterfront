<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/index.asp" target="_blank">FINALLY
WE HAVE AN ONLINE BEACH REPORT</a>.

<p>It's on the City of Kingston website, under "Residents", then "Recreation".  At the moment apparently two beaches, Lake Ontario Park and Rotary Park, are posted.

<p>The information is not date-stamped, so you'll have no idea of information freshness.  Let's hope this isn't another web page the city has no time to maintain.

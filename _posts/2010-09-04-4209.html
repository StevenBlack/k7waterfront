<p>THE PROPOSAL for an <strong>8-km multi-purpose trail</strong> on the West Side of the Greater Cataraqui River is on the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2010/COU_Agenda-2010.pdf" target="_blank">
City Council Agenda</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  for Tuesday September 7th.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the agenda is so packed that they likely won't get to it. For years <strong>Harvey Rosen has been a miserable failure</strong> at chairing Council meetings such that now <strong>Council's backlog is beyond laughable.</strong></p>

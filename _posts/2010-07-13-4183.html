<p>THE POKER RUN is on the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/focus/agenda/2010/FOCUS_A0810-SchedA.pdf" title="Link to the relevant agenda document" target="_blank">FOCUS Kingston
Steering Committee Agenda</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  for their July 15th meeting.</p>

<p>It's amazing that a KEDCO report that <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews042010.html#4127" title="It's true, read the KEDCO report" target="_blank">KEDCO itself says is
inaccurate and statistically insignificant</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is nonetheless touted, <em>again</em>, by City Staff apparently desperate to supinate for the BIA, greenwash the event, and give all this a positive cultural and historical spin.</p>

<p>Still no word on requiring Poker Runs America to purchase <strong>obnoxious-offset-credits</strong>.</p>

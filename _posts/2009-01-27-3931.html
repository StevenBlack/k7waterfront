<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/9500USGal-350.jpg" alt="" class="floatright bottom" title="Kingston dumped enough sewage to completely fill 280 of these tanks into the river on January 13 2009.">
<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews012009.html#3923" target="_blank">
TWO WEEKS AGO, ON JANUARY 13TH</a>  the City of Kingston allegedly <strong>dumped 10 million litres of sewage into the St-Lawrence River</strong> during a power failure in the City's East end.

<p>That's <strong>enough sewage to completely fill 280 of these wholesale-sized tanker trailers</strong>.

<p><a href="http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1388427" target="_blank">Here's
a Whig article</a>  about it.

<p>But there is  <strong>still nothing tallied</strong> on the crappy <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">Utilities
Kingston sewer bypass log</a>.  Not even a note.

<p><strong>Jim Keech</strong> is President and CEO of Utilities Kingston.  Mr Keech is well-aware of this and <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews042008.html#3768" target="_blank">
other past disclosure shenanigans</a>  by Utilities Kingston.

<p>When you think of sewage in our waterways, and the health of Kingston waterfront, think of Jim Keech and Utilities Kingston. And remember: <strong>these are the same folks responsible for getting safe drinking water to your tap</strong>.

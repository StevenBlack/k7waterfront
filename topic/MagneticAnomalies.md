''One way to picture this'' is to imagine
an underground deposit of magnetite
that runs deeper towards the East.

<li> [[http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/field/pdf/magnetic_declination_chart.canada.2000.pdf Magnetic <i>declination</i> chart of North America]] -- Declination at Kingston is 13 degrees West.
<li> [[http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/field/pdf/magnetic_inclination_chart.canada.2000.pdf Magnetic <i>inclination</i> chart of North America]] -- Inclination at Kingston is between 71 and 72 degrees North from horizontal.

From [[http://www.boatnerd.com/facts-figures/lkont.htm BoatNerd, facts and figures about Lake Ontario]]:
<blockquote>
(28) Local magnetic disturbances.-- Differences from normal variation of from about 006 W to 007 E have been observed at numerous locations throughout Lake Ontario. Differences of up to 37 have been observed in the approach to Kingston, Ont., on the N side of the head of the St. Lawrence River. The locations of these anomalies are shown on NOS chart 14500.

<blockquote>Using autopilot heading east (toward Fort Henry) 200m off the shore out of Portsmouth is liable to be very exciting. Just off the water plant, expect your boat to steer sharply toward the rocks! Whoopie!</blockquote><br>

<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/05/05/great-lakes.html" title="Link to a CBC report." target="_blank">MAYORS WANT GREAT LAKES BEACHES
PROMOTED</a>  according to a report released today.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.glslcities.org/documents/MCAPReportV6.pdf" title="Link to the 44-page PDF titled A Mayors Collaborative Action Plan to Protect the Great Lakes" target="_blank">
link to the 44-page report</a>  which, take note, isn't provided by <em>any</em> of the online "professional" mainstream media "covering" this today.</p>

<p>It's a <strong>5-point plan</strong>.
<ol>
<li> Create a Municipal-Provincial-Federal Great Lakes Table.</li>
<li> Improve and promote beaches, natural areas, wetlands, trails and tourism.</li>
<li> Attack nuisance and toxic algae.</li>
<li> Reduce untreated sewage and stormwater discharges entering the great lakes, especially in light of climate change and technical innovations.</li>
<li> Build a business case and measure results from Great Lakes investments.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>There may be no better way to strengthen the public's connection to the Great Lakes than to enhance and
promote beaches and other shoreline activities such as wetlands, natural areas and trails. Drawing more people
to the shoreline can also boost local economies and contribute to healthier lifestyles. With a greater share
of Great Lakes shoreline than any other jurisdiction, it makes sense to promote Ontario as a major beach and
shoreline destination.</p></blockquote>

<p>One <strong>wonders about Harvey Rosen's role in all this</strong>.

<p>When it comes to waterfront around here, it's been <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" title="All about Kingston's deteriorating waterfront" target="_blank">absolutely
all-downhill</a>  during his tenure.</p>

<p>One can easily imagine Harvey Rosen, a minority dissenter, clinging instead to some half-baked plan to siphon more tax-dollars for his cronies Downtown.

<p><strong>Beaches? Trails? Parks and wetlands? Harvey Rosen?  Please!</strong>

<p>Remember this scene from the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews072008.html#3828" title="Link to the 2008 mass-swim announcement" target="_blank">July 22 2008 Mass
Swim</a>  (also <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews072008.html#3835" title="Link to the 2008 mass-swim reports" target="_blank">here</a> )?  The event sought to raise awareness about our woefully neglected beaches.

<p>All signs indicate that 2009 will be <em>another</em> summer woeful beach maintenance, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews072008.html#3836" title="News item from July 2008" target="_blank">woeful beach safety reporting</a>  (also <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews062008.html#3813" title="News item from June 2008" target="_blank">here</a> ), and more of the usual Kingston recreational infrastruture degradation.

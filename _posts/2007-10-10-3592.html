<p>NATHAN BARON has been working hard towards his goal of qualifying and sailing in next year's <a href="http://www.transat650.org/en/" target="_blank">solo Transat 650 race</a>.  He's often out in Kingston Harbour practicing, and he recently completed a <a href="http://withoutletters.com/2007/09/28/toronto-training-run/" target="_blank">Toronto
Training Run</a>.

<p>He's also documenting his journey with over 120 photos so far in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davincispalm/" target="_blank">this Flickr
photoset</a>.

<p>Nathan plans an "Open Boat" event on October 21st from 1-3pm <a href="http://kingstonyachtclub.com" target="_blank">at KYC</a>  where people can come down to see the boat up-close and get a taste of what life aboard a mini is like.

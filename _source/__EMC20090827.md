## Downtown Museum to get splash of cash for badly needed repairs Posted Aug 27, 2009
BY BILL HUTCHINS


The Pump House Steam Museum is slated to get $400,000 for badly needed repairs.

The 19th century museum showcases a bygone era when steam was used to power giant fly wheel engines to pump drinking water from Lake Ontario.

The city-owned building on Ontario Street now helps to power the local tourism industry, but has decaying brickwork and other fixtures that need preservation. Council approved the repair money during the recent capital budget talks.

"It's so fundamental to the economic well being of the downtown," said Coun. Rob Hutchison.

Some of the money will also be used to develop a business plan to expand programs in the Victorian-era pumping station which ceased operation in the 1950s after a modern water filtration plant was built on King Street.

The museum, which first opened for public tours in 1973, also showcases a variety of model trains including the CBC"s 'Friendly Giant' model train set.

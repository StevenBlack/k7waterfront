You live in Kingston.  You're aware of the water, but you don't feel a connection to it.  You sense you're missing out.
Surely there must be economical waterfront options for you. Discuss.

###Enjoying your waterfront from shore###

Kingston's waterfront has a lot to offer, and you don't need access to a boat to be connected to the water.

*  Check the calendar of [upcoming events][upcomingevents]
*  We have [many waterfront parks][parks] in Kingston.
*  Learn and explore the [major geographic features][majorgeographicfeatures] of Kingston's waterfront.
*  We've got some [beaches][beaches], though they are unsupervised, not great quality, and it's likely they'll be posted.

###Get involved as a volunteer!###
Many waterfront [upcoming events][upcomingevents] need volunteers.

*  Volunteering is a great way to get yourself out on the water.
*  It's also a great way to meet great people.  Volunteers are givers.
*  Volunteer for [CORK](http://cork.org/volunteer.html) which runs intensively through most of August but also all summer long.


###Get proactive!###
Most of Kingston's [oustanding waterfront clubs][clubs] offer:

*  Reasonably-priced introductions and courses for adults and children
*  Typically these are open to non-members.
*  Book these early in the Spring because they are often sold-out.
*  This typically comes with new-membership discounts that encourage course-taking non-members to join.


###Get invited!###
The majority of sailors, rowers, and powerboaters got their start because someone took them out on the water.  Consider simply asking someone to take you out.  It works!

*  We have many [marinas][marinas] in the region serving boaters who collectively own thousands of boats.
*  Each one of those boats requires yearly maintenance, which comes from elbow-grease.
*  Many of these boats require more than one person to operate, and many don't leave the dock for lack of crew.
*  Therefore <strong>it never hurts to ask</strong>, especially it that comes with an <strong>offer or willingness to help</strong> with chores, or help with crewing.
*  It doesn't hurt to have proper clothing, soft-soled shoes, a lifejacket, snacks, and beverages when attempting to get yourself invited.


###Get involved because it's a Good Thing###
The reason Kingston's waterfront is fundamentally ruined is because citizens in the past allowed that to happen.

*  If something doesn't seem right, speak up.
*  If a proposed waterfront development doesn't sit right with you, speak up.
*  If a waterfront park isn't being maintained the way you'd like, call the City and complain about it.
*  See trash washed-up on the shore?  Pick it up.
*  Encourage others to do likewise.

##A really good guy###Kingston native Ron Clark was an unsung Queen's football star
By BY PATRICK KENNEDY

In the mid-1960s, the sporting populace of north-end Kingston could count its local heroes on one hand with a couple of fingers to spare.

There was the battling blue-liner from Kingscourt, Jimmy Dorey, and flame-throwing southpaw pitcher Doug McIlroy, pride of the Swamp Ward and ace of the local senior nine.

And there was Ron Clark, a sturdy, strapping product of the "fruit belt" who gave north-end pigskin patrons a reason to cheer extra long and loud come autumn Saturday afternoons at limestone-walled Richardson Stadium.

Clark, longtime manager of the Kingston Memorial Centre and a two-term commodore of the Kingston Yacht Club, died suddenly last week.

"As a fullback, he was as tough as they come," recalled three-time collegiate all-star guard Bob Climie, whose son, Jock, followed in his footsteps at Queen's. "He was an outgoing guy who played with tremendous heart and played a hard-nosed game."

In 1968, Clark, already with three years of gridiron seasoning under legendary coach Frank Tindall, was a key spoke in the Tricolour wheel that rolled to a 42-14 Vanier Cup victory over Waterloo Lutheran, the first national crown in school history.

"Clarkie sure opened a few holes for me," said Keith (Skip) Eaman, the all-Canadian halfback who copped league MVP laurels in '68. "He was a good blocker who wasn't afraid to stick his head in there, which is what it takes.

"He was a big-time competitor but also such a wonderfully uncomplicated guy," added Eaman, a successful Montreal-based businessman. "People knew where they stood with Ronnie. He was a straight shooter, a no-nonsense kind of guy who, even though he wasn't a great motivational speaker, was one of our leaders. With Clarkie, it was, 'We know what we need to do, so let's do it.' "

A fearless fullback, Clark played on two championship teams during his five campaigns with the Golden Gaels. When it came to effort, the big, bruising blond never delivered less than 100 cents on the dollar, nor would he let others short-change the club.

"That 1968 team was a unit that stressed teamwork and Clarkie was a leader in that area," said Ottawa lawyer and hall-of-fame Queen's quarterback Don Bayne. "He was a smart, reliable all-around player, a real character who played his best in big games, someone who never let you down."

Clark never longed for the spotlight but was only too content to help shine it on gifted running backs such as Eaman and Heino Lilles.

"That's the life of a fullback, you get your nose dirty and don't complain," added Bayne.

The six-foot-one, 210-pound fullback could surprise a defence with deceptive speed; they already knew he was bull-strong.

"We audibled into a Fullback 10 and Ron broke it for 82 yards," Bayne said, recalling a touchdown from that '68 playoff run. "That's the kind of thing he could do, though mostly he was happy to clear the way for others."

Clark was the only child of George and Edith Clark, the former a retired penitentiary guard who later drove hack, the latter a homemaker who, like her husband, once worked at the old Davis tannery.

"We've been friends longer than I can remember," said Clark's childhood pal Don Dennee, a Kingston realtor. "He was a really good guy."

In their mid-teens, they worked as ushers at the old Odeon Theatre. Truth be told, one could slip in for free if one could slip Clark a cigarette or two.

"Funny thing was, we'd work all day at the Odeon, get off work and go down to the Capitol Theatre to watch a movie," chuckled Dennee.

When he learned of Clark's death, Dennee drove to Megaffin Park and "just sat." His friend's childhood phone number flashed to mind like it was yesterday instead of more than a half-century ago.

After earning his degree, Clark taught in Bermuda for two years, then briefly at Loyalist Collegiate.

In 1974 he junked the teaching career and joined the staff of the Memorial Centre. Two years later, he took over as manager and ran the place for the next 22 years, opting for early retirement during the 1998 amalgamation.

During that period, he also served as yacht club commodore, the first time from 1991-93 and again during the club's centennial in 1996.

"His tenure was one of dynamic leadership," said friend John Lowther, who served as harbourmaster under Clark. "He was a terrific manager who could motivate people into getting things done."

Lowther said Clark was a non-sailor who joined the club in 1983 on a social membership. He put the muscular newcomer to work crewing with him on his 24-foot shark sailboat.

"I don't know to this day why he joined," Lowther admitted, "other than, I suppose, to expand his horizon."

""He was a genuine north-end hero," said retired Ottawa policeman Peter Cuthbert, who hailed from Frontenac Street. "He was a star at [Queen Elizabeth] high school, cut the Gaels camp and played on some great Queen's teams. We tracked him all the way through Queen's.

"I thought the world of the guy," he added.

Clark lived with his second wife, Sheryl, at the home that his late parents built in 1960 in the Glen Lawrence subdivision off Highway 2.

Last Wednesday he was helping a neighbour build a patio and hauling flagstone in a wheelbarrow. He collapsed and died.

"Heart attack," confirmed Sheryl, mother of the couple's two children (Clark also has a 40-year-old daughter from a previous marriage).

"He'd lost some weight but hadn't been sick at all," added the widow, who now instead of celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary tomorrow will bury the former Q. E. standout the following day.

A Service of Remembrance will be held Wednesday at 1 p. m. at St. Paul's Anglican Church.

"He never really retired," said Sheryl. "He was like his dad -he couldn't sit still."

Nor could he outlive George Clark. Both died at age 63.

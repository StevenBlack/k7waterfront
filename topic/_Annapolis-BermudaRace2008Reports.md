**Bermuda June 19, 2008  2:30 pm**

Boys and Girls Club of Canada wins her class in the Bermuda Ocean Race!

Skipper Nathan Baron and crew Greg Vanrossem **finished 16th overall, out of 27 starters in the Bermuda Ocean Race** in the their first go.

**WELL DONE BOYS!!!!!**  You guys are amazing!!!!

The Boys and Girls Club of Kingston, Kingston Yacht Club and Canada are immensely proud.

Today (Thursday) at about 2:30 pm Nathan and Greg crossed the finish line.   It was not an easy sail.  They saw just about every possible condition.

The first 25 hours was 25+ knots on the nose and progress was slow. Once out in the Atlantic the first gale hit.  With winds at 40 + knots the littlest boat in the race by about 20 ft, was in her element.  "She handled Fantastically!  Nothing broke.  This boat is fantastic!" reported Greg.

Two nights ago another gale hit.  "The physical demands were intense" said Nathan.  We are very glad to be on dry land but I am totally pumped about this boat!  It handled so well!"

Most of the race was a close reach once out in the Ocean.  The top speed was 22 knots!!!!  This was achieved with the spinnaker up.  For those [following the race](http://charthorizon.com/races/2008_annapolis_bermuda/htdocs/) that was when they appeared to go wide of the rhumb line.

"During the first gale we were reefed and then the wind suddenly died. It was the middle of the night.  We knew we must be in the eye of the storm so we did not shake the reef out.  Sure enough the wind came back and we were glad to have the reef." (Nathan)

The last 12 hours into Bermuda were in perfect conditions - close reaching and warm.

After a well deserved rest, Nathan will turn his attention to preparing for the return voyage a few days from now.

We look forward to having pictures and more news very soon.

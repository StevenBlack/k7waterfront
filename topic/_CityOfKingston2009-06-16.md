##City To Restore Shoreline Section, Improve Pathway###Construction To Start This Summer; Design Available For Review

The City is now developing designs to restore Kingston's shoreline and improve its waterfront pathway from the foot of Simcoe Street over to and including the West Street boat launch and the back of 33 Ontario St. -- or, roughly, between the Kingston Yacht Club and the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes.

The designs, to be implemented this summer, are the subject of an upcoming public information session on Monday, June 22, at 6:30 p.m. in Memorial Hall at City Hall, 216 Ontario St., and are now posted for review at www.cityofkingston.ca/waterfront/.

The improvements are moving forward based on the City's Waterfront Strategy now part of Kingston's Recommended Draft Official Plan (cityofkingston.ca/officialplan/).

<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/press/release.asp?mode=show&amp;id=2629" title="Link to the June 16th press release" target="_blank">YEARS OF DEFERRED
MAINTENANCE</a>  has come to the point of requiring a public meeting about a small stretch of Kingston Waterfront.
<blockquote>
<p>The designs, to be implemented this summer, are the subject of an upcoming public information session on Monday, June 22, at 6:30 p.m. in Memorial Hall at City Hall, 216 Ontario St., and are now posted for review at <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/waterfront/" target="_blank">www.cityofkingston.ca/waterfront/</a>.

<p>The improvements are moving forward <strong>based on the City's Waterfront Strategy now part of Kingston's Recommended Draft Official Plan (<a href="http://cityofkingston.ca/officialplan/" target="_blank">cityofkingston.ca/officialplan/</a> )</strong>.
</blockquote>

<p>We can't find any reference to this area of waterfront in <em>Kingston's Recommended Draft Official Plan</em>.

<p>Here are some <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/2009proposedShorelineRepairs" target="_blank">photos
of the area</a>  taken from the water.

<p>It looks like this has turned-into a <strong>major piece of work</strong> that can't be deferred any longer and will involve the closure of the <strong>West Street Launch Ramp</strong> for a period of time this summer.

<p><strong>Here's the deal</strong>:  Instead of <strong>decades of neglect</strong>, how about <strong>regular required and preventive maintenance</strong>?  Instead of <strong>doing nearly nothing for decades</strong>, why not <strong>fix problems as they occur?</strong>  Each spring, improve things a little bit.  After a major storm, go down and check if anything washed-away.  If so, fix it immediately.

<p>As things appear now, with respect to the waterfront, Kingston's official plan isn't about <strong>better waterfront living</strong> or even <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">clawing
back what we've recently lost</a>.  The official plan is apparently more about <strong>doing obvious repairs</strong>, merely fixing things that should never have been permitted to remain broken in the first place.

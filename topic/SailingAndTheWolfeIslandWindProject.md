##A place for notes on the effect of the [[Wolfe Island Wind Project]] on sailing in Kingston

<h3>From the perspective of sailboat racing...</h3>
<img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/WolfeIslandWindProjectKingstonWindRose.jpg" class="image1px floatright">
Here "<strong>prevailing</strong>" means South, SW, and West breezes.

These things seem immediately evident:

<ol>
<li> The sprinkling of highly visible and reliable wind indicators all over Wolfe Island will forever change the tactics of sailboat racing in Kingston Harbour.

<li> We'll be able to watch the seabreeze setting up, and shutting down, and diurnal evening breezes shutting down, because the general velocity and direction of near-upper air flow will be completely obvious.

<li> The synoptic flow will be obvious, and interesting seabreeze battles should be visible.

<li> Turbulating and impeding prevailing-direction flow over Wolfe Island generally implies a veer, a progressive Starboard tack lift, while nearing Wolfe Island in Kingston Harbour in prevailing breeze.  Therefore, if anything, this will tend to <i>reduce</i> the "Go Left" imperative, at least somewhat.  Plain and simple: velocity and direction aside, the turbulation just fuddles the left side somewhat, making it less attractive, and from a regatta-quality-in-prevailing-winds-perspective, that could be a Good Thing.

<li>Wind in the championship circles, Bravo and Foxtrot, won't be affected at all

<li>The Bateau Channel, which usually pays, gets a bias downgrade in prevailing conditons, which may balance route selection in distance races.

<li> Other thoughts?

</ol>

<h3>From the perspective tourism and/or Kingston's reputation for good winds</h3>

<ul>
<li>The visibility of this wind farm from the Kingston waterfront and in the media can only enhance Kingston's reputation for [[Wind|good winds]].  This alone may result in an increased interest in sailing in the Kingston area.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From the perspective of kiteboarding in Brown's Bay...</h3>

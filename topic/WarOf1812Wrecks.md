##The bicentennial of the war of 1812 is fast approaching

There are three ships in Kingston waters that are flagships from the war of 1812.   Those would be
<ul>
<li> the HMS St Lawrence,
<li> the HMS Prince Regent, and
<li> The HMS Montreal.
</ul>

Kingston has a vast and interesting maritime history and to have three ships that were flagships at one time or another during there life here is a phenomenon.

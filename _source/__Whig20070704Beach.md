Rotary Park beach is unsafe for swimmers, the public health department said today. In a press release, it said 10 water sample tests over the past 2 weeks have shown the level of E.coli organisms is unacceptably high.

The beach at Lake Ontario Park was also called unsafe for swimming last week.

Rotary Park is on Coverdale Drive, west of Bayridge Drive, near Lemoine Point.

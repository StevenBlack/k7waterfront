##KFL&A Public Health posts area beaches unsafe for swimmers
After the signs at a number of local beaches were removed last week when the test results showed the water quality was safe for swimmers, signs are being posted on other area beaches in the KFL&A area as unsafe for swimmers after water sample tests have shown higher than acceptable levels of the indicator organism (non-specific E.coli). Fairfield Park beach in Amhertview and DuPont / Invista beach in Kingston have both been posted unsafe for swimmers by KFL&A Public Health. The maximum level for safe swimmers is no more than 100 organisms per 100 mL of water. These beaches join Rotary Park on Lake Ontario and Lake Ontario Park on Lake Ontario already on the list since earlier this summer as unsafe for swimmers. All remain posted unsafe for swimming. A complete list of beaches in the KFL&A area posted as unsafe for swimmers is posted on KFL&A Public Health’s website www.kflapublichealth.ca. Posted beaches are reopened when consistent tests show levels of the indicator organism are within acceptable levels.

“As with the other posted beaches, , we are not sure of the cause of the high levels of organisms in the water at Collingwood Beach, but we are sure that it’s not a safe place for swimmers,” said Penny Lavalley, Director of the Infectious Disease Prevention Program at KFL&A Public Health. “These beaches have been posted as unsafe for swimmers and we will continue to resample the water and will reopen these beaches once we have consistently safe results.”

Posted beaches are marked with a large format sign that reads “WARNING THE WATER AT THIS LOCATION IS NOT SAFE FOR SWIMMING. DO NOT SWIM.”

<a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/News.aspx?Report=Beach" title="Click to see the bare-bones KFL&amp;A Health Unit Beach Report web page" class="floatright" target="_blank"><img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/BeachReport2009-06-08.jpg" alt="KFLA Beach Report"/></a>

<p>THERE'S APPARENTLY NO IMPROVEMENT since <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews072008.html#3836" title="Link to the K7Waterfront post from July 2008" target="_blank">last July</a>  to the so-called "<a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/News.aspx?Report=Beach" title="Link to the KLFA Health Unit Beach Report web page" target="_blank">Beach
Report</a> " we're getting from the Health Unit.

<p>What's worse, <strong>it's nearly mid-June and the City of Kingston is still not listing beach quality information</strong>, or links to beach quality information, on its <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/index.asp" title="Link to the City of Kingston 'Environment' landing page" target="_blank">Environment</a>  or <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/index.asp" title="Link to the City of Kingston 'Recreation' landing page" target="_blank">Recreation</a>  landing pages.

<p>The main problem with our Health Unit's Beach Report remains the <strong>lack of disclosure</strong> which is in stark contrast with the quality of beach information other areas are getting.

<p><strong>Here's the data we need to see</strong>:
<ul class="simplebullet">
<li><strong>The exact date</strong> the sample was collected.
<li><strong>The specific level of <em>E.coli</em> found</strong>, as they do in <a href="http://www.hpechu.on.ca/applications/web_cms/index.php?pageid=550&amp;menuid=1570" title="Link to the Hastings and PEC online Beach Report" target="_blank">Hastings
&amp; Prince Edward Counties</a>  and <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/beach/ecolilevels.htm?menu1selected=0&amp;menu2selected=0&amp;menu3selected=7" title="Link to the Toronto online Beach Report" target="_blank">Toronto</a>.</li>
<li><strong>How, exactly, was the sample collected</strong>?  Was it from a boat perhaps hundreds of feet off-the-beach, or within a few yards of the waterline where children actually swim?</li>
<li><strong>The sampling history</strong> for each location so the propensity and volatility of <em>E.coli</em> contamination can be reckoned.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Because just "Open" or "Closed" isn't nearly good enough</strong>.

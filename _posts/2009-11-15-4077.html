<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2009/A22_Rpt117.pdf#page=27" title="Link to the Council report" target="_blank">THIS</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is <strong>scandalous</strong>.  Get a load of this:

<p>At the next Council meeting, senior city managers <strong>Cynthia Beach</strong> and <strong>Lanie Hurdle</strong> (remember the wonderful, wonderful LVEC project?) want to add $200,000 to the budget for <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/TokenPark" title="Link to more on this sad-joke of a waterfront park" target="_blank">Token
Park</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  to cover some glaring planning oversights.  Like lighting, and accessibility.

<p>To finance this, these people want to filch <strong>$55,000</strong> from the city's waterfront improvement account, <strong>$55,000</strong> from the cycling and pathway account, and <strong>$90,000</strong> remaining in the City Park splash-pad account.

<p>Because, you know, we're up-to-our-eyeballs in recreational infrastructure here in Kingston.

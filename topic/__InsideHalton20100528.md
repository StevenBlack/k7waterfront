##No swimming

###Caught up in a mini heat wave, residents are being advised to avoid bathing in Lake Ontario until E. coli testing is completed

"At this point in time, the level of E. coli is unknown because we haven't started our monitoring yet, so the beaches are basically closed at this time because we don't have any data available." - Jacinth Miller, Supervisor of Environmental Health, Halton Region</div>

This week's heat wave has led many locals to seek relief in the cool waters of Lake Ontario.

However, Halton Region's health department recommends people refrain from swimming before levels of E. coli are tested through its beach water-monitoring program.

The health department collects water for testing at seven beaches in Halton, including the north and south sections of the Beachway along Lakeshore Road in Burlington.

Testing starts the first Tuesday in June, which means it will start on June 1 this year.

This means that until the middle of next week, E. coli levels in the water along the local beaches are unknown.

"At this point in time, the level of E. coli is unknown because we haven't started our monitoring yet, so the beaches are basically closed at this time because we don't have any data available," said Jacinth Miller, supervisor of environmental health with the region's health department.

"(Staying out of the water until testing starts) is something I would recommend. Once testing starts, I would recommend that they call the region's beach water line and find out the conditions before they head out to the bathing areas."

Swimming in water with high levels of the bacteria can lead to an increased risk of infection in the ears, eyes, nose and throat. Stomach illnesses may also occur if the water is swallowed.  Skin rashes can also be caused by contaminated water.

Five water samples from each of the north and south beaches are collected on Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout the summer until the last Thursday in August. However, since Labour Day is later this year, on Sept. 6, testing will continue until the last Thursday before the holiday weekend, which is Sept. 2.

"For the most part, it is once a week for the five bathing areas that we test in Halton, but for Burlington, we do carry out a second test on Thursdays because of the frequency of use and high numbers of bathers using that area," Miller said. "Conditions can change from day to day, so the more current the results, the better."

Samples are analyzed for E. coli, which is found in the intestines and feces of warm-blooded animals, by the provincial Public Health Laboratory in Hamilton.

Water is considered unsafe to swim in if the average level of E. coli is higher than the provincial guideline of 100 E. coli/100 ml of water.

Last year, the north and south beaches were closed several times, according to Miller.

"The beaches were sampled on 26 occasions in 2009," Miller said. "Beachway North was closed a total of six times in 2009 for a total of 35 days, while Beachway South was closed a total of three times for a total of 19 days using the geometric mean of 100 E. coli per 100 ml of water."

Miller said that Beachway North, located north of the snack bar, has a greater number of birds than Beachway South, which appears to impact water quality.

Test results will be available Wednesdays and Fridays by dialing 311 or 905-825-6000 and accessing the region's beach hotline or by going online to the region's website at www.halton.ca and typing Halton Beach Water Test Results in the search box.

If the water is unsafe for swimming, the region also contacts the City of Burlington, which posts signs along the beach informing swimmers that the water is unsafe.

A number of factors can influence the amount of E. coli in the water, such as pet waste runoff, warm winter temperatures, boating waste, sewer overflows, large populations of waterfowl, and seasonal and storm surface run-off.

"After a heavy rainfall, for example, the run-off can add an additional load from E. coli to the water from animal waste or bird droppings," Miller said.

Those using the beach are asked to help keep the area clean by not using soap in the water, avoid attracting animals or birds by limiting the amount of food taken to the beach and not feeding animals or birds. Boaters using the lake are asked to practice pollution-free boating.

Miller reminds dog owners that animal feces can contaminate the water.

"If animals go to the bathroom on the beach, the E. coli from the excrement could wash into the water and be a potential hazard," Miller said. "We strongly encourage them not to take their animal on the beach."

Burlington bylaw states that dogs and other animals are not permitted in the water or on the beach at any point. Waterfront ambassador staff will be speaking to dog owners on the beach regarding the bylaw, and animal control officers will be enforcing the bylaw if needed.

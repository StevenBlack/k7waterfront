<p>Yesterday The Whig Standard published this <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/WolfeIslandWindProjectCable10DayNotice" target="_blank">
Notice of Application and Hearing</a>  for the underwater cable <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/PatersonPark-WolfeIslandWindProjectCable" target="_blank">
(see diagrams)</a>  that will link the <a href="http://www.wolfeislandwind.com/project_docs.htm" target="_blank">Wolfe
Island wind project</a>  with the mainland.  People have until March 16th to make presentations of concerns on the matter, and until April 5th to send letters.

<p>A notable point of contention is the plan to pass a 230 kV power cable through one of the best swimming spots on the Kingston side, on the mostly smooth flat rock off <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/PatersonPark-WolfeIslandWindProjectCable" target="_blank">
Paterson Park</a>.

<p>Could this please be done in a sensible and respectful manner, to minimize the possibility of flaking and erosion of the layered limestone bottom, both short and long term?  Can we please pick the best place and best way to come ashore, one which might be just a few dozen metres one way or another, in recognition that people of all ages should be swimming barefoot there, say, for the next few centuries of summers?

<p>Everyone concerned about this popular swimming/windsurfing area off the point near Paterson Park should send their comments to the Ontario Energy Board before April 5. You can send an email outlining why you think cable routing should absolutely respect people's continued long term bare-footed recreational use of the smooth flat-rock reef to <a href="mailto:boardsec@oeb.gov.on.ca?subject=File%20EB-2007-0034%20Comment" target="_blank">
boardsec@oeb.gov.on.ca</a>. Be sure to include the file reference number <span class="importantdata"><strong>EB-2007-0034</strong></span> in the subject of your email.

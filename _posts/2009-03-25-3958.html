<p>The <a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1491587" title="Article and photo in The Whig" target="_blank">QUEEN'S PERFORMING ARTS
CENTRE DESIGN</a>  was unveiled earlier this week.  According to The Whig, it's quite something.

<p>A thoughtful reader points out that plans are unclear about its waterfront aspects.  The waterfront here has long been <strong>a neighborhood and community park for the launch of kayaks, swimmers, windsurfers and scuba divers</strong> both east and west of the Stella Buck Building.

<p><strong>Now this area is controlled by Queen's</strong>.  Here's hoping this doesn't turn into <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" title="Kingstonians have lost a lot in recent years" target="_blank">yet another
loss of accessibility</a>  to the residents of Kingston.

<p>Considering the number of CFB Kingston Scuba Club <a href="http://dolphinscubaclub.blogspot.com/search/label/Tett%20Centre" title="SCUBA diving blog posts tagged with 'Tett Centre'" target="_blank">blog
posts tagged with 'Tett Centre'</a>, this site is used 12-months a year, day or night, and it's evidently one of the nicer <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/wc.dll?K7Water~Wrecks" title="List of Shore Dives near Kingston" target="_blank">shore dive locations</a>  in the Kingston region.

<p>Wouldn't it be great to see <strong>active waterfront accessibility</strong> built-into the project?

THE RIDEAU WATERWAY HAS SCORED HIGH MARKS IN A JUST-RELEASED SURVEY ON WATER QUALITY.

ENVIRONMENT CANADA COMPILED SAMPLES FROM RIVERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

AND IT GIVES THE RIDEAU A 75 OUT OF 100.

THE TRENT RIVER ALSO SCORED WELL FOR ITS POLLUTION COUNT.

ON THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE -- TORONTO'S DON RIVER. IT'S BEEN DUBBED ONTARIO'S DIRTIEST RIVER... SCORING 34 OUT OF 100.  THE "DON" IS CAKED WITH SEWAGE, CHEMICALS AND THE OCCASIONAL SHOPPING CART.

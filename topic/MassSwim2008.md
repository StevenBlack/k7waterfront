##MASS SWIM  -  July 22, 6pm  -  [[Richardson Beach]]
###(Please circulate widely)

**PUBLIC SPACE -- PUBLIC WATER**

Come out and show your support for **restoring Richardson Beach** (just east of [[Murney Tower]], at the foot of Emily St).
The purpose of this event is to demonstrate the need for improvements that would allow for safe, public access to Lake Ontario.
The swim will take place **rain or shine**.

We will be getting into the water at **6pm on Tuesday July 22**.
Bring footwear to protect your feet (one of the reasons for improving the site!).

There will also be an information and consultation session by the City of Kingston from 6-8pm.
City staff will present their preliminary plans for landscaping improvements to the historic Richardson Bath House area,
as well as improving access to the water for swimmers.

The following organizations will be on hand to provide additional information about water quality, public space and local history.

* KFLA Public Health
* Kingston Historical Society
* Lake Ontario Waterkeeper

The waterfront at Richardson Beach has been enjoyed as a public space since the late 1800s.
It features a beautiful bath house constructed in 1919 and dedicated "To the Children and Citizens of Kingston".
Despite overall improvements in water quality, the beach has fallen into disuse over the last two decades.
We now have an opportunity to bring public swimming back to the heart of Kingston.

This initiative is being undertaken to encourage a speedy restoration of the site and to build support for public water
and public space in Kingston.

For more information contact **Jamie Linton** (Jamie.linton@queensu.ca, 344-0232) or **David McDonald** (dm23@queensu.ca, 546-9710).

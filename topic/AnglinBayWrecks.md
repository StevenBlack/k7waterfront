<h3>Wrecks in Anglin Bay</h3>
January 31, 2006

With low water levels (January 2006) various wrecks in the Kingston area become more visible.  Among these are shipwrecks located just outside Anglin Bay.

In the mid-19th century, the area outside [[AnglinBay]] became a graveyard for abandoned wooden ships.  Many of these ships were later raised, and taken to new graveyards off [[WolfeIsland|Wolfe]] and [[AmherstIsland|Amherst]] Islands. Ones that were too badly damaged by fire or ice were left.  A 1994  survey found approximately 12 wrecks in this part of the [[CataraquiRiver]].

Parts of hulls (particularly ribs) can be seen slightly above the ice surface today.  At least two are visible off [[DouglasFluhrerPark|Douglas L. Fluherer Park]], and two are visible off the end of Molly Brant Point.

Many of these ships belonged to the Montreal Transportation Company whose shipyard used to be at the entrance to Anglin Bay, and Canada Steamship Lines (CSL), headquartered in Montreal.

The wrecks are not to be disturbed as they are archeological sites under the Ontario Heritage Act.

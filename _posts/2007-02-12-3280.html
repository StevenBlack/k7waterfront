<p>Buried in the 2007 City budget, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ImperialWarehouse" target="_blank">THE
IMPERIAL WAREHOUSE</a>, a 100-year old limestone building on the City waterfront, is apparently to be torn down.
<p>The city has let this heritage building go to the dogs for a long time.

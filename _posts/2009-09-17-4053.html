<p><strong>AN UNBELIEVABLY STUPID IDEA</strong>, renaming Breakwater Park after <strong>a 1758 transient who couldn't possibly lose</strong>, gets <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/press/release.asp?mode=show&amp;id=2689" title="Sept 22 public meeting to focus on renaming Breakwater Park" target="_blank">

<p>To be <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20090905" title="Maj. John R. Grodzinski, history prof at RMC, wrote this letter to the Whig, published September 5th. Therein:" target="_blank">

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Between Bradstreet's departure in 1758 and the arrival of the first surveyors in 1783, there was no European settlement at Cataraqui.</strong> The French fort and outer buildings lay in ruins and the area was of little interest until the closing of the American War of Independence.

<p><strong>There is no truth to the popular claim that Bradstreet helped lay the foundation of Kingston</strong>. This is not to diminish the significance of his raid or his role during the Seven Years' War, but it took another conflict and the emergence of a new military and refugee problem for the British to gave Cataraqui a new lease on life, leading to the founding of "Kingstown."

The Kingston Historical Society</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, unable to prevent the <strong>perpetual renanaming of Market Square after modern-day narcissists</strong>, grasps at straws for relevance.

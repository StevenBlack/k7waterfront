PUBLIC ASKED FOR INPUT</a>  on Lake Ontario Park's master plan.

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/parks/lop/survey.php" target="_blank">
token 4-question online survey</a>, and two public meetings are planned, the first on January 21 and the second on March 25, 2009.  The January 21 public meeting is between 7 to 9 PM at the Invista Centre.

<p>Let's hope this isn't just public consultation theatre like we've seen with so many City and island projects in the recent past.

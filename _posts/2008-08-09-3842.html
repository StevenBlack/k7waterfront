OP-ED BY JAMIE SWIFT</a>  in today's Whig Standard about the obnoxious <strong>Poker Run</strong>, which is this weekend.

<p>A group of concerned citizens has been <strong>distributing postcards</strong> around town protesting the poker run.  Here you can download the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/PokerRun(Front).pdf" target="_blank">front</a>  and the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/files/PokerRun(Back).pdf" target="_blank">back</a>  of that postcard, which is addressed to Mayor Harvey Rosen. <!-- <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20080809"> -->

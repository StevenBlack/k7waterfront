<p>THE <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">CITY
SEWER BYPASS LOG</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  was updated sometime late yesterday (November 20) to acknowledge November 16th bypasses of  34,753 cubic meters (<strong>7.6 <i>million</i> gallons</strong>) due to heavy rains.  This represents a delay of four days between the event and the acknowledgement on the website.  At the same time, the city acknowledges 755 cubic meters (<strong>166,100 gallons</strong>) for November 11-14, which is a six to nine day delay, and a further 159 cubic meters (<strong>34,980 gallons</strong>) on another, presumably prior date.
<p>If you get the sense that the city is providing this environmental accounting grudgingly, and in a half-assed way, you would be right.
<p>For example, we learn that <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">October
hath 32 days</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  Honest mistake? or maybe they really don't give a damn?  You decide. Just know that we waited 24 hours to post this story hoping they'd fix obvious mistakes like this.  So far, they haven't.
<p>There's more: The Whig reported, on November 18th, citing Jim Keech, president of Utilities Kingston, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/_Whig2006-11-18" target="_blank">bypasses of
50,000 cubic meters</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, not the 34,753 currently being acknowledged by the City.  What's going on?
<p> The City doesn't even provide a "last updated" or "valid through" date on the sewer bypass page, so anyone looking-in within a few days of a heavy rain, even a week or more hence, would mistakenly conclude there were no bypasses.
<p>All this isn't good enough, and the waterfront deserves better and prompter sewer bypass accounting than we're getting.

Despite the completion of expensive upgrades to Kingston’s sewer system, the amount of untreated waste the City of Kingston discharged into area waterways in 2006 increased slightly from the previous year, says a new report.</p>

Last year, the city spilled nearly 140 million litres of raw sewage into Lake Ontario and other area waterways, compared to 126 million litres in 2005.

A report that went to council this week stated that the 2006 flows did not follow the downward trend of the previous year due to above-average rainfall over the course of the year.

Jim Keech, president of Utilities Kingston, attributed the increase to two storms last October and December.

“Up until those two storms, which were unusual, we thought we were having a darn good year,” he said.</p>

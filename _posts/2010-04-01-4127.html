ECONOMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  of the <strong>2009 Thousand Islands Poker Run</strong> is on Council's next agenda.

<img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/KEDCO-PokerRun.jpg" class="floatright bottom" title="Link to the KEDCO report on the 2009 Poker Run" alt="KEDCO report cover page">
<p>The <strong>KEDCO report</strong> is based on a survey (conducted by the Downtown BIA) and phone interviews (with spokespersons for Poker Runs America and Power Boating Canada). </p>

<p>All strong proponents of the Poker Run.</p>


<p>Despite the claim of attracting <strong>14,500 spectators</strong>, KEDCO and the BIA could gather only <strong>91</strong> survey responses. These are noted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that conclusions based on 91 results is "statistically insignificant" and does
not adequately reflect the overall economic impact of the event. In this case, the economic
impact report is inaccurate and would not be considered as part of a post-analysis report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the survey results are not reliable and are of no value.  However, this doesn't prevent KEDCO from extrapolating conclusions and tabling them with six- and seven-digit precision. </p>

<p>Does the report contain <em>some reliable information</em>?  <p>Apparently not.  The report <strong>doesn't tell us how many boats</strong> were in in the 2009 Poker Run.

<p>The number of boats according to <a href="http://kingstonwhigstandard.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1692542" target="_blank">
The Whig last August</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, was "<em>more than 60</em>" which is far less than the hundred or hundreds usually touted by organizers.

<p>Wouldn't you expect KEDCO to provide, at a minimum, data that could be used, for future comparisons?. By <strong>omitting the number of boats</strong> from this economic impact report -- one of the only available objective measures of event quality and scale -- KEDCO effectively delivers a report with little future-reference value.<p>


<p>The report claims that the 2009 event had <strong><em>304 participants</em></strong>, or <strong><em>360 participants</em></strong> depending on whether you read paragraph 3, or paragraph 4, on page 7 (<a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2010/COU_A1110-10128.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">
page 11</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  of the council PDF).  How "<em>more than 60-boats</em>" turns into KEDCO's "304 participants" or "360 participants", including spouses and children, we do not know..

<p>In view of the non-disclosure of the number of boats, the lumping of driver's spouses and children to inflate the number of "event participants", this all appears <strong>very suspicious</strong>.


<p>Furthermore there's <strong>no mention of <em>any</em> negative survey responses</strong>.  Several survey questions have "good" at the low-end of multiple-choice responses but a possible response of "poor" was only related to the questions related to "music quality" and "the variety of events".</p>

<p>In many respects this KEDCO report, as tabled, tells us a lot about <strong>KEDCO and the BIA in the Rosen-era</strong>.

<p>In effect, the report says "<em>we have no reliable data</em>" and "<em>we don't tell you even the easiest objective metrics</em>" but, nonetheless, "<em>the poker-run generates MILLIONS</em>".</p>

<p>Related to that, the report's <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2010/COU_A1110-10128.pdf#page=1" target="_blank">
cover-page</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is notable because of its <strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Release of Liability Statement</em></strong>, which we haven't seen before from KEDCO.</p>

<p>Do you think this might be, partly, because of fallout from KEDCO's <a href="http://business.kingstoncanada.com/en/aboutus/resources/economic_impact_april_2005.pdf" target="_blank">

<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.amherstislandwindinfo.com/harrison-caa-presentation-0910.pdf" title="Link to professor Harrison's paper: Inadequacy of Wind Turbine Noise Regulations and their Application" target="_blank">
INADEQUACY</a>  of Wind Turbine Noise Regulations and their Application</em></strong> is an interesting paper recently presented by Queen's University Physics professor <a href="http://www.physics.queensu.ca/People/profile.php?show=1&amp;id=219" title="Link to Professir Harrison's faculty web page" target="_blank">John P
Harrison</a>  to the Annual Conference of the Canadian Acoustics Association.</p>

<p>It's an interesting technical read.

<p>As you go through it, keep in mind that <strong>the Wolfe Island Wind Farm's minimum setback is only 400m</strong>.</p>

<p>The Ontario Government, in its recent <a href="http://news.ontario.ca/mei/en/2009/09/ontario-makes-it-easier-faster-to-grow-green-energy.html" target="_blank">
Green Energy Act</a>  has proposed <strong>a minimum 550-metre setback</strong> from residences for wind projects involving five or fewer turbines, with greater setbacks -- <strong>up to 1,000 metres</strong> -- for projects of more than eight turbines.  </p>

<p>Wolfe Island has 86 turbines.</p>

<p>Wolfe Island falls <strong>ridiculously short</strong> of the Ontario government's own proposed health and safety guidelines for wind industry development.</p>

<p>History already shows that <strong>Wolfe Island was a development pushover</strong>. Island leaders have a lot to answer for. And who was the Provincial Minister responsible for this? That would be Kingston's own <strong>John Gerretsen</strong>, Minister of the Environment.</p>

<p>We've been <strong>pwned</strong> by our own.</p>

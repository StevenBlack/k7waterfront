WATERFRONT</a>  in today's Whig.

<blockquote>
<p>At Lemoine Point, an orange lifesaving ring and rope hang from a steel post below a sign.

<p>The sign warns that swimming is unsupervised and cautions that "strong winds and high waves cause dangerous conditions."

<p><strong>The sign and ring, however, are located roughly 100 metres from the waterfront</strong>, next to the gravel access road at the north end of the conservation area.

<p><a href="http://www.pokerrunsamerica.com/calendar.html" target="_blank">THE 1000
ISLANDS POKER RUN</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is currently scheduled for Friday and Saturday August 8-9.

<p>That's just two days, compared to last year's 3-days.

<p>As usual, it overlaps with the <a href="http://www.cork.org/schedule.html" target="_blank">CORK PHRF and
One-Design Keelboat Regatta</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, which makes no sense whatsoever.

<p>It is also immediately prior to the <a href="http://www.cork.org/schedule.html" target="_blank">CORK Optimist Dinghy
Championship</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, when lots of youth sailors are on the water practicing.  For many young sailors and their parents, it's an obnoxious introduction to Kingston's waterfront.

##A place for notes on the effect of the [Wolfe Island Wind Project][wolfeislandwindproject] on sailing in Kingston

###From the perspective of sailboat racing...###

Here "**prevailing**" means South, SW, and West breezes.

These things seem immediately evident:

*  The sprinkling of highly visible and reliable wind indicators all over Wolfe Island will forever change the tactics of sailboat racing in Kingston Harbour.

*  We'll be able to watch the seabreeze setting up, and shutting down, and diurnal evening breezes shutting down, because the general velocity and direction of near-upper air flow will be completely obvious.

*  The synoptic flow will be obvious, and interesting seabreeze battles should be visible.

*  Turbulating and impeding prevailing-direction flow over Wolfe Island generally implies a veer, a progressive Starboard tack lift, while nearing Wolfe Island in Kingston Harbour in prevailing breeze.  Therefore, if anything, this will tend to *reduce* the "Go Left" imperative, at least somewhat.  Plain and simple: velocity and direction aside, the turbulation just fuddles the left side somewhat, making it less attractive, and from a regatta-quality-in-prevailing-winds-perspective, that could be a Good Thing.

* Wind in the championship circles, Bravo and Foxtrot, won't be affected at all

* The Bateau Channel, which usually pays, gets a bias downgrade in prevailing conditons, which may balance route selection in distance races.

* Other thoughts?


###From the perspective tourism and/or Kingston's reputation for good winds###

* The visibility of this wind farm from the Kingston waterfront and in the media can only enhance Kingston's reputation for [good winds][wind].  This alone may result in an increased interest in sailing in the Kingston area.</li>

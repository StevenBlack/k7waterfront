<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2010/COU_A2010-10283.pdf" title="Link to the CAO's report on the 2014 ISAF World's bid" target="_blank">HERE'S
THE LINK</a>  to the City and KEDCO reports asking Council to back CORK's bid for the 2014 <a href="http://www.sailing.org/" target="_blank">International Sailing
Federation</a>  World Championships.</p>

<p>It's good to see the City and KEDCO finally pulling together for regattas and <strong>sorely-needed regatta-related improvements</strong> to our aging (<a href="http://k7waterfront.org/wc.dll?K7Water~PortsmouthOlympicHarbour#hoist" target="_blank">
crumbling?</a> ) marina infrastructure.</p>

<p>Also interesting is the 21-page <a href="http://www.sailing.org/tools/documents/2014ISAFSailingWorldChampionshipsBidGuidelines-%5B9027%5D.pdf" target="_blank">
ISAF Guidelines for the 2014 Worlds</a>. Read the whole thing; it involves very significant on-water assets, concessions to ISAF micro-management, and deference to an expensive <strong>IOC-style "V.I.P." culture</strong>. Almost all of this excess is supposedly on <strong>the host committee's tab</strong>.</p>

<p>Do all aspects or European-style sport-federation dictates fly here in North America, specifically here in Kingston? Certainly not.</p>

<p>These time-sensitive reports go before Council for approval on Tuesday evening.  <strong>Any delay means Kingston misses deadlines to bid.</strong>  The last-minute nature of this is almost entirely due to the ISAF, who recently decided to hold the event in 2014, not 2015 as originally expected.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.perth2011.com/" target="_blank">2011 ISAF Worlds</a>  are in Perth, Australia in December 2011.</p>

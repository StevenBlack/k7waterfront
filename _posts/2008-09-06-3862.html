THE PROPOSED RENAMING OF BREAKWATER PARK</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, a move by the Kingston Historical Society, is on the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/lacac/agenda/2008/HA_Agenda_1008.pdf" target="_blank">
Municipal Heritage Committee agenda</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  for the September 8th meeting.

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Parks" target="_blank">Breakwater Park</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is the 8.4 acre waterfront park along King St West that today contains, among other things, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tyner/259103583/" target="_blank">the iconic
sculpture named "Time"</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.
<img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/John_Bradstreet.jpg" class="floatright image1px bottom" alt="John Bradstreet">
<p>The proposal is to name the park after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bradstreet" target="_blank">Lt.-Col.
John Bradstreet</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">, the British officer who led <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Frontenac" target="_blank">the
"battle" to overthrow Fort Frontenac</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  250-years ago.

<p>John Bradstreet had 3,000 men at his disposal against 110 French soldiers garrisoned inside the Fort.  The French surrendered without a fight. Then Bradstreet plundered, burned, and demolished the fort.  Then Bradstreet left town.

<p>Which raises the questions: Why? Bradstreet, and why Kingston's premier waterfront park?

<p>Should such honours be reserved for, say,  <strong>people who actually lived here?</strong>  Does Kingston's history not have valorous military commanders who <strong>didn't enjoy a 30-1 man advantage upon arrival?</strong>  How about, say, <strong>somebody who actually built something?</strong>  As opposed to John Bradstreet, who extracted a quick surrender, then plundered and demolished the place before immediately moving on.

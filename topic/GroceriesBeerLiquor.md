##Where to get Groceries, Beer, and Liquor near the Kingston waterfront

We can't sugar-coat this, and it probably qualifies as a [[Disappointments|disappointment]], but if you need supplies while docking in Kingston, from most [[marinas]] you'll need to hike or take a cab.  There is simply nothing within convenient walking distance for you.

Well, one bright spot. The grocery store in 'downtown' Bath now sells beer & wine. If you stop at Loyalist Cove Marina, its maybe a twenty minute hike. (Hardly convenient, I agree. What's twenty minutes for a beer? Oh! They also have groceries.)

Come to think of it, it's also pretty close from the Flora MacDonald Basin to the LCBO and Food Basics store, isn't it?

Here's a map (still under development) of where to go.

<p>Over at <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/RideauMarina" target="_blank">Rideau
Marina</a>  the South boathouse is being torn down.  It's being removed because it covers some deeper-water slips that many boaters hesitate to rent because they are under cover.  Very soon those slips will be wide-open.<p>

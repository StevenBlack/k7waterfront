The Parking area has been "updated/expanded" by the city during the "night" hours of late June 2006. The clear cutting of some trees with addition of new gravel/bulldozing along with the addition of parking curb stones has occured in the past week, early July 2006... but alas ! ;  the upgraded area has now been signed as permit parking only for rent on a M-F basis 8am - 5pm..from the City.

So much for the idea of having a betterment to parking without paying  -- Is this a loss of some parkland for a NEW PARKING LOT called "The Douglas R Fluhrer Parking Lot" ? - not yet listed on the City website of parking lots  ... see it yourself - 40 some odd spots to appease downtown parking space losses???? ---  come early if you wish to vist this waterfront park as parking is NOW limited.

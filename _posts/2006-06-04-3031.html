<p><a href="http://www.trilliumpower.com/" target="_blank">Trillium Energy Power
Corp</a>  apparently plans to build a <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1149027011527&amp;call_pageid=968350072197&amp;col=969048863851" target="_blank">
140-turbine, 710-megawatt wind farm</a>  off <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/MainDuckIsland" target="_blank">Main Duck
Island</a>.
<p>To give a sense of the scale of this, only 122 megawatts of wind-generated power exists in the province of Ontario today.  710 megawatts would be sufficient to meet the needs of 200,000 homes.  This would be the biggest offshore wind farm outside of northern Europe.

<p>A SCAN FROM THE PAST: You are looking at a small-sized scan of the navigation chart created for the 1976 Olympic Sailing events (or Yachting as it was then known).

<p>Olympic sailing was hosted in Kingston and it remains, 31 years later, the pinnacle of <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ListOfMajorRegattasInKingston" target="_blank">Kingston's
impressive regatta history</a>.

<p><strong>The chart shows several very interesting things</strong>:
<ul class="simplebullet">
<li><p> The sailing events were held way out in Lake Ontario, southwest of Simcoe Island.  The racing area was a full 5-miles from P.O.H., and Course Charlie, used for Tornado class catamarans, was another 5-miles beyond that.
<li><p> The racing area was bounded by 52 orange spar buoys.
<li><p> Within the racing area, near its southern edge, there was something called Bedford Tower which isn't there anymore.  Whatever it was, there was a 300m exclusion zone around it.
<li><p> Note the detailed bathymetry of Portsmouth Olympic Harbour, and the layout of the site for the Olympic event.
<li><p> Also see how, prior to the 1984 expansion of Confederation Basin, Kingston Harbour was dotted with many spar buoys leading to the Lasalle Causeway along Carruthers Shoal.  Old-time dinghy sailors will remember these well, as they served as ideal boathandling practice marks.

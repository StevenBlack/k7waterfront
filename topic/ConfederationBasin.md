The <b><i>Flora MacDonald Confederation Basin</b></i> is usually referred to as simply 'Confederation Basin". It is located directly in front of City Hall and is sheltered by two excellent breakwaters. Boaters are advised not to enter through the gap between Shoal Tower and the north end of the new breakwall. A white and orange buoy indicates that this is not navigible. Instead, use the buoyed entrances. Transient slips are located in front of the Raddison Hotel - visitors should call ahead on Channel 68.

[[Portsmouth Olympic Harbour]] and Confederation Basin both have a telephone reservation system (613 546-4291 Ext. 1887) which allows visitors to book 24 hours in advance.

Major expansion in 1988.  Currently 384 slips.   There is no fuel, and no pumpout, at Confederation basin.

  Currently ([[http://k7waterfront.org/files/RFPforMarinaDevelopmentStrategyandBusinessPlan.pdf#page=9 2008]]) Confederation Basin consists of <strong>160 seasonal berths</strong> and approximately <strong>215 slips for transient traffic</strong>.

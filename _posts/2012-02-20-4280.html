<p>The <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2012/COU_A0712-12068.pdf" target="_blank">
2012 PRIORITY MATRIX</a>  is presented to Council on Tuesday's (February 21, 2012) meeting.</p>

<p>The matrix is presented in a new format this year, segmented in three exhibits. It's too bad the exhibits aren't properly labeled.</p>


<p><strong>Exhibit A</strong> lists 49-items due for completion in 2012.  We find <strong>nothing related to waterfront</strong> in Exhibit A.  There's also nothing related to bike trails or parks unless by "park" you mean parking.</p>

<p>So don't hold your breath to see waterfront accessibility improvement this summer.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Exhibit B</strong> lists 42 initiatives for completion between 2012-2014.  Those of waterfront interest:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Item #1 is labeled "Study: Lakefront/waterfront plan" and has <strong>no due date</strong> or shows no comments.</li>
	<li>Item #38 is labeled "Visioning for Douglas R. Fluhrer Park" and has a compeletion date of Q1 2014 which is a <strong>ridiculously long timeline</strong>. You can tell there is no will to do this.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Exhibit C</strong> lists 33 all initiatives from the Corporate Work Plan in Kingston's Strategic Plan that are due for completion in 2013 and 2014.  <strong>Just one item</strong> has a waterfront component:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Item 14 is "Upgrade and complete construction of the Lake Ontario Park rejuvenation plan" and it's listed as Q4 2013.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>That's it.</strong> Three items out of 124, and two of those are studies with either no due date or a ridiculously long horizon.</p>

<p>This is all <strong>very disheartening</strong>, of course.  Kingston's relationship with waterfront <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/DisappearingWaterfront" target="_blank">continues
to suck</a>.</p>

<p><strong>More importantly</strong>: Why aren't stages of the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/GreatCataraquiRiverTrail" target="_blank">Great
Cataraqui River Trail Project</a>  not listed as priorities by 2014?

##Notable Changes in Waterfront Policy
###Customs, and passenger vessel security (since 2002)###

Fences, crew testing, customs and immigration delays - all of this makes it harder to get to Cape Vincent from Wolfe Island, or to Boldt Castle from Gananoque, which is tough on travelers, vacationers, and the boat lines.

<h3>The General Wolfe Hotel dock</h3>

A prime and mostly deserted Wolfe Island dock is "for hotel guests only", with excess capacity even at the height of summer.

<h3>Big Sandy Bay beach fees (since 2006)</h3>

An [$8 per head](http://www.bigsandybay.ca/faq/admission-fees) fee for day-use is now in place.

<h3>Confederation Basin pay-and-display docking fees</h3>

[Started in summer 2007](http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20070630).

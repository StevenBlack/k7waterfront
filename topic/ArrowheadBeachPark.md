<blockquote> The <b>Arrowhead Beach Park</b> is a public beach accessed through the CFB Kingston Married Quarters. Enter the base at the Mcdonald's restaurant, follow Niagra Park Drive as far as you can. Turn left and take the unpaved road to the right just before the Community Centre. Park next to the Yacht Club. <br>
The beach is a great 'swimming hole' in front of several acres of well kept grass and mature pines. There is a small playground above the beach.

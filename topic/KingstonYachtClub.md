The <a href="http://KingstonYachtClub.com/Wind">KYC online wind sensor</a> is located atop the crane on the club breakwall which protrudes somewhat into Kingston Harbour.  It's display shows the recent history of wind velocity and velocity range, and direction.  Take note that this sensor is prone to gaps in responding, so be sure to check the "Last Updated" label to ensure you aren't looking at stale, or in some cases <i>really</i> stale, data.

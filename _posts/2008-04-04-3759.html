<p><a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">MASSIVE
SEWAGE DUMPING</a>  by the City of Kingston over the past several days.

<p>The dumping of the past few days has exceeded the tally for all of 2007 by a considerable margin.

<p>Dumping for 2008 year-to-date is way ahead of ALL of 2006 and 2007 combined.

<p>Word from the Dolphins Scuba club is, at West Street, <strong>this is a visibly nasty flow of immense quantities of fecal matter, toilet paper and sanitary supplies</strong>.

<p>Shame on the City of Kingston for its massive spending on things like OHL arenas, squares, and theatres, and so today we continue to despoil a natural lake.

<p><strong>No word yet about this from local mainstream media</strong>.

<p>Finally, shame on Utilities Kingston for placing this information way down on their <a href="http://www.utilitieskingston.com/water/bypass/bypasses.html" target="_blank">combined
sewer overflows bypass log</a>.

<p>When you look at the initial viewpane for that page, you see nothing recent worthy of note.   You need to scroll way down to see the real news.

<p>They call it a "bypass log".  It's nothing like a bypass log.  It's a selective and obfuscated tally, with no links to details.

THE SPINY WATER FLEA</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is the subject of an interesting article in The Whig yesterday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anglers on local lakes are being asked to let their lines, nets and other gear dry completely between fishing expeditions to prevent the spread of a parasite that a Queen's University researcher (Dr. Shelley Arnott) fears is taking over Ontario's lakes.
</blockquote>

<p>The same proscription presumably applies to boats and trailers.

##Why no park, walkway yet at Block D development site?
This week, I drove to the east end of Earl Street. The city's Official Plan shows a requirement for a clear view of the water's edge from all along Earl Street. This view is not available, even from Ontario Street. Instead, there is a hill made of the backfill from the Block D construction project.

My motivation was to look at the progress made on the waterfront walkway and park that I understood the developers were committed to providing.

I was deeply disappointed to find that Earl Street now ends in a private parking lot and a fence that prevents citizens from getting to the walkway area.

Neither the walkway nor the park yet exists. Even the residents of Earl Street are unable to reach the park area.

Are the developers cheating the citizens of this city in ignoring former commitments to us?

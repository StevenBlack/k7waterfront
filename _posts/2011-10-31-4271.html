INTERESTING AGENDA ITEM</a>  for the November 1st Council meeting.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<strong>City staff is recommending the addition of Pay and Display parking on the west side of Emily Street</strong>.  This is a prime parking area for Kingston General Hospital patients and visitors.  The additional parking spaces will also accommodate waterfront park users, <strong>particularly windsurfers at Richardson Beach</strong>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is great because recent renovations to the Richardson Beach area eliminated some parking, and the west side of Emily street has been a no-parking zone for many years.  It looks like this is about to change.</p>

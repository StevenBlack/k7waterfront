THE GREAT CANADIAN SHORELINE CLEANUP</a>  goes-down on Saturday September 19th at 9:00 am.

<p>Kingston's <strong>official shoreline cleanup locations</strong> include
<ul>
<li>Breakwater Park and MacDonald Memorial Park
<li>Doug Fluhrer Park, on the Cataraqui River
<li>Marine Museum of the Great Lakes Shoreline and Dry Dock.
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vanaqua.org/cleanup/home.php?initialSearch=Kingston.%20Ontario&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank">
official website</a>  appears very officious, with allusions that signing-up is required.

<p><strong>Don't be put-off by that</strong>.  It's probably because they need to plan for the number of t-shirts, clipboards for the always-interesting tallies, garbage-bags, pick-up logistics, and whatnot.

<p><strong>Just show-up</strong>.  If they don't have a TD-Bank-branded t-shirt for you, that's tough.  It's well-worth doing.  <strong>The area <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/k7waterfront/3625944401" target="_blank">around</a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/k7waterfront/3626767748" target="_blank">the</a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/k7waterfront/3625957289" target="_blank">Marine
Museum</a>  in particular needs some TLC</strong>.

<p>Or, you could just grab a couple of green garbage bags and some gloves, don your boots, and <strong>head-down to your favorite stretch and make it a little better</strong>.  Any day.

<p>See <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26615119@N07/" target="_blank">photos from
past cleanups</a>.  It looks like fun.  <strong>The people you'll meet are all givers</strong>.

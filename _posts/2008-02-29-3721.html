A CHALLENGE FROM COLLINS BAY MARINA</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  in support of the <a href="http://www.IWLC.org" target="_blank">International Water Levels
Coalition</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  (IWLC).

<p>The IWLC is a citizens group that acts as a watchdog and advocate on water level issues to the <a href="http://www.ijc.org/en/home/main_accueil.htm" target="_blank">International
Joint Commission</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  (IJC) and <a href="http://www.islrbc.org/new-Version/engmain.html" target="_blank">International
St. Lawrence River Board of Control</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  (ISLRBC).

<blockquote>
<p>The IWLC mission is tremendously important, <strong>but their membership, especially in Canada, is quite small</strong>. This year, <a href="http://collinsbaymarina.com" target="_blank">Collins Bay Marina</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  took steps to help expand that membership and strengthen their voice on our behalf.
</blockquote>

<p>The challenge is to other marinas and clubs to urge their members to support the IWLC.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We would like to challenge each marina, association, boating business and yacht club on the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario to mount a similar membership drive for the IWLC</strong>.  Aware citizens, active in making our needs known to government, are the only route we have to protecting our waters, our recreation and our businesses.

CALLING ALL MARINE MUSEUM AND ALEXANDER HENRY FRIENDS</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  - Plan to join us for a taste of 'Icebreaker Ale' on <strong>Monday, 17 August 2009, beginning at 6 pm, upstairs at the Kingston Brew Pub, 34 Clarence Street</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Kingston Brewing Company</strong> has very generously agreed to <strong>brew a celebratory libation</strong> for the Alexander Henry's 50th, and it will be unveiled/untapped, or whatever one does to launch a beer, on the 17th. <strong>Fifty cents from the purchase of each glass of Icebreaker Ale will be donated to the Marine Museum</strong>.</p>

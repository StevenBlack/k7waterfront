##Boaters finally get vessels back in the Bay

By W. Brice McVicar, The Intelligencer

It was a bittersweet event at the former Morch Marine property on Friday as boaters who had, for weeks, been left landlocked were finally able to have their vessels placed into the waters of the Bay of Quinte.

The property — currently held in receivership by BDO Dunwoody — was the site of continuous activity as employees from Bayside’s Bay Marine lifted boats and placed them into the water through the use of a lift. The activity came after the property was taken over by BDO Dunwoody last month.

An Ontario court ruling placed the company in control of the property, taking it away from Belle Harbour Developments Inc.

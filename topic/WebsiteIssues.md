##A place for listing the website's issues

<li> Most topics have no content.  Then again, that's what volunteers and Kingston winters are for.
<li> No mission statement.
<li> Need a way to place multiple URLs into a Google infobubble
<li> Need to handle special characters, like "&", in Google infobubbles
<li> Suggestion: Add a title to maps.
<li> Suggestion: A style sheet for printing.
<li> Camtasia videos of the site operations.
<li> Page should not crash if a duplicate marker label is used
<li>   It would be nice to default some Google Maps to "Satellite" view.

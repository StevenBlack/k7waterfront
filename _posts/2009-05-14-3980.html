<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2009/A12_Rpt54-Update.pdf" title="Link to the Council report (PDF)" target="_blank">A RICHARDSON BEACH
UPDATE</a>  is on the Council agenda for next Tuesday.  12-pages in all.

<p>The words <strong>"windsurf"</strong> and <strong>"sail"</strong>, and any reference to <strong>current users</strong> of the beach, appear <strong>exactly zero-times</strong>.

<p>So the railroad is running perfectly.  How perfectly?  <strong>The consultant's report is dated April 9th</strong>.  What's a <strong>five-week disclosure delay</strong> when you and your plans aren't accountable to anyone in particular?

<p>Oh, and the plan changes drastically.  You thought maybe the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/img/maps/parks/RichardsonBeach_Plans.jpg" title="Link to a large JPG of the old concept" target="_blank">old plan</a>  wasn't windsurfer-friendly?  Here's the <a href="http://K7Waterfront.org/files/RichardsonBeach2009-04-05RevisedConcept.pdf" title="Link to the latest concept schematic" target="_blank">new (5-week-old)
schematic</a>.

<p>This much appears certain: <strong>another summer will pass with no beach improvements in Kingston</strong>.

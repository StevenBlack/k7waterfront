<p><strong>NOTHING SAYS "KINGSTON"</strong> like the document titled <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/planning/agenda/2010/PLN_A0210-10001.pdf" title="Link to the document" target="_blank"><em>City of Kingston Waterfront
Strategy - Past Directions</em></a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  which is part of the upcoming January 7<sup>th</sup> Planning Committee meeting agenda.

<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the document is <strong>borderline unreadable!</strong> When did it ever become OK to post unreadable documents for the public? This has been going-on for years.

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, the online document is <strong>incomplete</strong>.
<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit 'A' -- 'Waterfront Strategy - Past Directions' which forms part of this report is being circulated under separate cover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The public needn't concern itself</strong> with the specific contents of the <em>"approximately 40 studies and reports (that) were undertaken during the past 30 years"</em>.

<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, get <strong>this</strong>:
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong></p>
<p>That the "Waterfront Strategy - Past Directions" document be accepted as background information for the Waterfront Strategy, which will assist in the development of policies and recommendations to conserve and manage the City's waterfront.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, <strong>duh!</strong> <p>

<p>Progress on the waterfront file is here <strong>masquerading</strong> in the form of this totally obvious "report" from Cynthia Beach (Commissioner, Sustainability and Growth) that supposedly lists the details of 40 waterfront-related studies conducted over the past 30-years, suggesting that the Planning Committee should take time to accept the recommendation to consider recommendations arising from these studies when planning for the waterfront.</p>

<p>And so it goes.</p>

<p>Ever wonder <strong>how Kingston ended-up with a wasted waterfront?</strong>  One reason is we have a Planning Committee that doesn't expect very much from City staff.

<p>This <strong>endless visionless wheel-spinning</strong> helps ensure that money for the Downtown will indeed be amply available whenever needed.  So, over time, we all end-up with, among other things, our fat-cat downtown and a shamefully wasted derelict waterfront.<p>

<p><strong>Skeptical about that?</strong> <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews012009.html#3925" target="_blank">

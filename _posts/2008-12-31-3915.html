FIVE BRICKBATS TO KINGSTON CITY COUNCIL (2008)</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is an interesting post by an apparently very well-traveled Canadian.</p>

<p>Here's <strong>brickbat number four</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>(4) the failure to create a walkable, enjoyable public downtown waterfront.</strong></p>

<p>One of the more annoying aspects of the mismanagement of Kingston is the absolute disregard the city has for its downtown waterfront.  Centennial park directly in front of City Hall doesn't cut it.  Nor does the little bit of pathway/public space between City Park west beyond KGH.  The absolute lack of interest in providing a walkable inviting downtown waterfront from Belle Isle down to the foot of Ontario St is an embarrassment and should shame each and every councillor.  It's not difficult - just takes some leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen, brother. <a href="http://juniorannex.wordpress.com/2008/12/30/five-brickbats-to-kingston-city-council-2008/" target="_blank">

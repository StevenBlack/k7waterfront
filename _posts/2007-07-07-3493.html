AT NEXT TUESDAY'S COUNCIL MEETING</a>, City staff seeks to <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2007/A15_Rpt72.pdf" target="_blank">
declare the property at 5 Brock Street as surplus</a>, paving the way for its sale to the Hotel that surrounds it.

<p>This is <strong>primo commonwealth property on the waterfront</strong>, adjacent to our downtown docks, and across the street from City Hall, Confederation Park, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ConfederationBasin" target="_blank">Confederation
Basin</a>, and historic Market Square.
<p>Or is it, potentially, Starbucks'?

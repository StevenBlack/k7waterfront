> Less than three quarters of a mile in length and lying close by the western entrance to Wolfe Island's Barrett Bay, **Garden Island** today consists of a sleepy village street and a few acres of hayfield and trees. Nonetheless, it has a fascinating history closely linked with the Calvin family of timber merchants and shipbuilders.

> The French called the small limestone-based island *"Isle aux Cochons"* (Pig Island). In the 1830's, the Calvin company began operations as a maker and forwarder of timber and staves. The firm grew in scope throughout the 1800's to include shipbuilding, wrecking operations, and towing services. Oak and later elm rafts were constructed at Garden Island, making the passage to Quebec from late April to November. Sixty-two vessels were also constructed on the island between 1839 and 1903.

> Without question, the barque ***Garden Island*** was the Calvins' finest effort. Two years in the building, she was oak framed and planked and 880 tons burthen. The firm kept her busy for seven years before selling her to Norwegian interests. She was wrecked in 1906.

> Garden Island had over 700 inhabitants at its peak. Centred on the 'foot' of the island, there was a mill, a powerhouse, sail loft, and machine shop, together with boiler shops, shanties, offices and storehouses. There was also a village school, a club and a library. In some respects, the island was perhaps a 'feudal' community. For example, one surprising rule that was strictly enforced over the years was the total prohibition of liquor. Yet the community thrived. For a great many years, Garden Island  was a separate municipality with its own post office, Reeve, school trustrees and magistrate. Sadly, with the passage of time, only traces of foundations among the undergrowth and disused pilings tell of the vibrant maritime industry that was based there.

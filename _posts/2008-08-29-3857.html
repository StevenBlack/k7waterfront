WE HAVE A NEW LOCAL SHORE DIVE</a>  off Kingston General Hospital.

<p>Divers from <a href="http://powkingston.org/" target="_blank">Preserve Our Wrecks Kingston</a>  laid a line leading to the charted wreck yesterday.  <a href="http://powkingston.blogspot.com/2008/08/line-laid-to-wreck-offshore-from-kgh.html" target="_blank">
Quoting the POW Blog post about it</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>The wreck is in very good condition; one of the more intact examples of what is certainly a sailing vessel and probably associated with use on the canal systems. It's almost a hundred feet long and about 24 feet wide. Care should be taken by visiting divers to avoid disturbing and damaging many upright features that have stood the test of time.</p>

<p>The wreck is well known already; it features on local charts, but it has not previously been of great interest, since it lies in the path of frequent boat traffic and didn't have any line to it from shore.</p></blockquote>

<p>While you are there, there's a new Google Map pin on the position of the <strong>HMS Montreal</strong> which was supposedly "discovered" earlier this month leading to <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20080819a" target="_blank">much</a>  <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20080821" target="_blank">fanfare</a>  in <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__MtlGazette20080823" target="_blank">mainstream

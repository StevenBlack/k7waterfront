PROVINCIAL POLICE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE ON THE HIGHWAYS AND WATERWAYS...

ONE AMERICAN BOATER HAD SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH NEW CANADIAN PENALTIES FOR DRINKING AND BOATING.

POLICE SAY A MAN ARRIVED BY BOAT AT COLLINS BAY HARBOUR MONDAY NIGHT ... WITH A BEER IN HIS HAND.

THE 41 YEAR OLD WAS OUT IN A SMALL BOAT LIKE THIS ONE, WITH NO LIGHTS ON .

THE AMERICAN TOURIST HAD HIS DRIVERS LICENCE SUSPENDED FOR 90 DAYS, DURING THAT TIME HE WON'T BE ABLE TO OPERATE VEHICLES OF ANY TYPE.

THE MAN IS FROM NEW YORK STATE BUT CONSTABLE RANDALL HADDRALL SAYS THE DRINKING AND DRIVING LAWS APPLY TO EVERYONE

HADDRALL:
    "HE CAN'T OPERATE A CAR, TRUCK, ANY MOTOR VEHICLE IN ONTARIO OR THE U.S. NOW, WHERE THERE'S RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS AND HE'S ALSO PROHIBITED FROM OPERATING ANY TYPE OF A BOAT FOR 90 DAYS AS WELL. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL PROHIBITION WE'VE ADDED ON BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF DRINKING AND BOATING. WE'RE JUST HAVING TOO MANY FATALITIES AND WE WANT TO STOP THAT." THE MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH OPERATING A VESSEL WHILE OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT OF ALCOHOL.

HE'LL APPEAR IN A NAPANEE COURT ON AUGUST 21ST.

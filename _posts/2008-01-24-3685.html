TOKEN PARK</a>  IDEA from a reader.  This is downtown Budapest, on the Danube.

<p>At the moment, <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/planning/blockd/BlockDPark_Phase2.pdf" target="_blank">
the plan for Token Park</a>  is for a large rubble-rock shoreline, which is inaccessible, ugly, and ubiquitous around here.

<p>In addition to adding a real sense of connection to the water, steps would make Token Park a little bigger, and opens the possibility of using the large, wide-open anchorage as a staging area, or as a competition area complete with viewing stands of sorts.

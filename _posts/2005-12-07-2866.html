<p>The <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/TettCentre" target="_blank">Tett Centre</a>, Kingston's waterfront arts haven, is under some threat, and some mobilization will probably be required to save it.  <b>Update</b>: The city <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/press/release.asp?mode=show&amp;id=1667" target="_blank">
hires Artscape, a Toronto firm</a>, to study the Tett Centre.

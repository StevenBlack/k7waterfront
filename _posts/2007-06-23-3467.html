<p><strong>NOTHING ABOUT BEACHES ON THE HEALTH UNIT WEBSITE.</strong>
<p>But <a href="http://www.healthunit.on.ca/factsheets/dp.cfm?action=Fact_Sheets_Details&amp;ContentID=87" target="_blank">
their website claims they inspect beaches</a>.  Just don't assume they make results available or anything.

<p>The Whig today has a <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20070623" target="_blank">beach safety
news story</a>  and, apparently, the local beach safety story is good for now.  Perhaps one must phone?  Better call during business hours, Monday through Friday, because otherwise they are closed.

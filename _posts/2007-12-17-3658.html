THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH AHOY RENTALS LTD.</a>  is on <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/council/council_agenda.asp" target="_blank">
Council's agenda</a>  for Tuesday evening.

<p>It appears that the <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews092007.html#3573" target="_blank">
timber frame exhibit shelter for the Phoebe</a>  is to be placed near where Ahoy Rentals is currently, so Ahoy will move southwest somewhat, with a new structure to be built there.

<blockquote>
<p>Ahoy will be licensed to rent out a maximum of twenty kayaks, six canoes, six sail boats (12'-16') and twelve bicycles, whereas under the former agreement eight kayaks, four canoes, eight sail boats, two windsurfers and an unspecified number of bicycles were rented from the site.
</blockquote>

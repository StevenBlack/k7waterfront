<p>THE FINAL OF THE WFN 2008 BASS TOUR, THE CANADIAN OPEN, which was supposedly coming to Kingston September 19-21, isn't going to happen.

<p>Apparently word of the cancellation has been known in fishing circles since <a href="http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=20039&amp;mode=linear" target="_blank">
late May</a>.

<p>By the looks of this, the folks at WFN are adept at self-congratulating press-releases <a href="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2007/13/c7679.html" target="_blank">
announcing the event</a>  (November 2007), then later <a href="http://www.wfn.tv/news/index.php?id=348" target="_blank">announcing
sponsors</a>  (Lakeport Beer in March 2008).

<p>But when things derail, mum's the word.

<p>The event is <a href="http://www.kingstoncanada.com/en/artssportsandrecreation/index.asp" target="_blank">
still listed on the KEDCO website</a>.

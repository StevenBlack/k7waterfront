<p>The <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2011/COU_A0211-11017.pdf" title="Link to the City Council Report" target="_blank">EVENT IMPACT ANALYSIS</a>  for the <strong>1000 Islands Poker Run</strong> will be meekly accepted by Kingston's new Council on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Read the whole thing, and judge for yourself.</p>

<p>It never seems to matter how <strong>transparently ridiculous</strong> these reports are, they always get forwarded, and are always accepted by Kingston City Council.</p>

<p>Sad thing is, it's <strong>far from the worst report</strong> on the evening's agenda.  That honour could go to the <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2011/COU_A0211-11018A.pdf" title="Link to the Kingston Airport report" target="_blank">Economic Impact of
Kingston Airport</a>  which says, brace yourself:

<blockquote>
<p>Total gross revenues generated by activities at Kingston Airport during 2009 are estimated to be $49.5 million.</P>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a hair under <strong>a million dollars a week</strong>.

<p>Apparently there's nothing pushover-commissioners Cynthia Beach and Denis Leger won't endorse to Council. The LVEC fiasco held no visible consequences for these two, and it evidently taught them nothing, so today the flow of bull <strong>continues unabated</strong>.</p>

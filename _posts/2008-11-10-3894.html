THE 2015 PAN-AM GAMES BID</a>  goes to Toronto's City Council today.
<blockquote>
<p>If (Toronto) council endorses the bid, <strong>a more detailed report is expected in February that will help lay out a venue plan</strong> and a detailed look at the financial, social, economic and infrastructure implications of the 2015 games. A formal bid must be submitted to the Pan American Sports Organization by April.
</blockquote>
<p>So KEDCO is running out of time to get the Sailing event for Kingston.
<p>Here's the 6-page <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2008/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-16632.pdf" target="_blank">
City of Toronto Staff Report</a>  on the matter.
<blockquote>
<p>The (Toronto) City Manager recommends that (Toronto) City Council:
<p><strong>1.</strong> Endorse the City of Toronto's role as the host city and participant in a bid to be
submitted by the Bid Corporation to host the 2015 Pan American/ParaPan American
Games in Toronto and <strong>communities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe region</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not looking good.

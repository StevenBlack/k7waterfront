<p>WATERKEEPER ROUNDUP: <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/fish/canada_slow_to_respond_to_fish.php" target="_blank">
Canada slow to respond to fish virus</a>  from The Whig, and <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/fish/issue_burns_in_bath.php" target="_blank">
Issue burns in Bath</a>, also from The Whig, about last week's stunning approval by the Ministry of the Environment that allows Lafarge to import and burn up to 100 tonnes of municipal waste per day, including tires, meat, bone meal and pelletized garbage for two years whilst, at the same time, banning it everywhere else.

##Students to build museum boathouse

High school students will build the boathouse that will become home to the only boat with its original engine and boiler left over from the days of the Davis Dry Dock Co.

The Phoebe is set to move back to the Pump House Steam Museum on Ontario Street next summer after a new boathouse is built to protect the old ship when it returns to the shoreline by the museum.

City staff approached the Limestone District School Board about having students in a construction program build the boathouse. The public school board recently said it felt the Phoebe boathouse project was a good fit for its students.

Students will begin work on the boathouse in February and finish it before school wraps up in June.

The city will cover $2,500 worth of tools and supplies for the job and make a $2,500 donation to the Limestone Learning Foundation that will go toward the construction program. Councillors approved the money in the 2007 budget.

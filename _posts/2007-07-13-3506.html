	<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/WindISAF2007PracticeDay.jpg" class="floatright image1px" alt=""/></a><p>IT WAS AN UNUSUAL DAY WIND-WISE for the <a href="http://www.youthworlds2007.org/schedule.shtml" class="out" target="_blank">Volvo Youth Worlds</a> practice races, which were supposed to happen on <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews052007.html#3438" target="_blank">
three race circles</a>  in early afternoon.

<p>A heck of a cell went through just before 9am, and it looked to be a fair day after that.  But a sequence cells passed through around mid-day, and the wind built dramatically throughout the afternoon.

<p>It turned into a classic Kingston buster, with <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/WindSensors" target="_blank">the wind sensor
at Kingston Yacht Club</a>  recording gusts to 40 knots.  The competitors were on water for a short while, blasting around, but the practice races never happened.  Good call.
<p><a href="http://kingstonyachtclub.com/Wind/" target="_blank"><img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/WindISAF2007PracticeDayKYC.jpg" class="floatright image1px" alt=""/></a><p>Here is the trace of average wind from the Kingston Yacht Club.  Anybody know why the pre-9am squall shows distinctively on the iWindsurf.com sensor, but not the <a href="http://kingstonyachtclub.com/Wind/" target="_blank">Kingston Yacht Club
sensor</a> ?  Both sensors are mounted at the end of the pier of the Kingston Yacht Club.  Maybe the squall was so brief there that it doesn't factor when averaged?

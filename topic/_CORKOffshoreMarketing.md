Hi Everyone:



I am considering creating a Great Lakes Regional Website for Olson 30 owners racing on the Great Lakes. The purpose of the site would be to encourage communication amongst owners and growth of the Great Lakes Fleet. In addition, I would like to start an Olson 30 Great Lakes Regatta which would be held annually at various venues across the region. I propose that the 2006 regatta be held in Kingston, Ontario as part of the CORK event which is held in mid August. We now have three boats actively racing in Kingston and I'm confident that we can get at least three more making the inaugural event a respectable fleet of six or more.



The website address will be: www.pridemarine.com/Olson30GreatLakesFleet.htm



Please respond with your feedback and let me know if you'd like your boat information listed on the site?



Cheers, Dave.

Other issues and sollutions

What role do you expect this committee to take on and with what authority?

Are we responsible for shore side entertainment/social aspect? If not, are we nothing more than cheerleaders without power to change things?

Where, how much, and who determines funding available to do the above?  Do we have a say in registration costs? Will money come out of "current registration fee"?

What limitations, if any, do we face in Portsmouth Harbour re available space, conflicting commercial interests/sponsors with Portsmouth tenants? Do we have right to put up tents? Can we bring in outside vendors for catering/food/entertainment?  If so what are conditions?  Where?  Can we make use of interior space if weather does not cooperate?  Do we have ability to set aside area for suitable rafting?

What is extent of Portsmouth liability for crane operation? For Larger boats (crane brought in)?  For smaller boats (existing hoist on site)?  Who will operate small hoist?
If a large crane is brought in can it be left on site for the week if needed?  Will larger boats have to pay additional fee for registration to use large crane?  If needed can we ensure that fee for large crane is "fixed" i.e. cost known in advance rather than based upon number of boats ultimately using the crane?  Will anybody come if we have open ended liability to cover cost of the crane?

I think we will be able to tell relatively quickly, if CORK is serious about effecting change to fix the regatta or not.  If we get quick positive responses to most of our questions we will be able to go forward.

<p><a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2010/COU_A0710-10067.pdf" title="Link to the Council report" target="_blank">NINE OPTIONS</a>  for the third crossing in the EA update to Council next Tuesday night.
<p>But that's <strong>probably theatre</strong>.
<blockquote>
<p>Tentatively, a report recommending the preferred option for the third crossing will be presented to Council on April 20th along with a staff briefing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can anyone imagine any recommendation other than <strong>the original route</strong> between Counter (Elliott) and Gore Road?

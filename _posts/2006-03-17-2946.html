<a href="http://www.brigantine.ca/" target="_blank">Brigantine Inc</a>  has some updates to their <a href="http://www.brigantine.ca/schedule.html" target="_blank">summer schedule
for St. Lawrence II</a>.   As always, they are looking for some <a href="http://www.brigantine.ca/donations.html" target="_blank">practical items
for donation</a>, things that you may have that no longer serve, such as a T.V. and VCR for classroom work, or used office equipment like printers and photocopiers. In this case, your junk may be their treasure, argh!

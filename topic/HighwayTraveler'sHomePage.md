##A place for advising highway travelers about stopover opportunities on Kingston's waterfront
<div class="context">
<p>You're passing Kingston on the highway.  Maybe you've got kids with you, or maybe not.  It's a nice day.  You could stop for a few minutes, or an hour or two.</p><p class="bottom">Are there any economical water-related options? Discuss.

<ul><li> See our [Kingston Mills Locks][kingstonmillslocks] page.
<li> North of Highway 401, just 1 km from the Highway 15 exit, or 2.6 km from the Montreal Street exit, on Kingston Mills road.
<li> The parking lot is just West of the swing bridge that spans the locks.
<li> You'll find a park with picnic tables, shade trees, grassy areas, trails.
<li> The site is clean and very well maintained.
<li> Bring your own snacks.  There's nothing to buy here.  There are convenience stores at the corner of Kingston Mills Road and Highway 15, less than a mile from the locks.
<li> Washrooms are wheel chair accessible.
<li> Great spot for a swim.
<li> Nice scenic walk along the four locks found there.
<li> Interesting for kids to see how locks operate.  In the summer, there are lots of pleasure boats locking up and down.
<li> Very nice rock climbing spot too.
<li> It's very pretty, interesting for kids, free, and it's all just a minute from the 401.

<h3> Chill in one of many [waterfront parks][parks]</h3><a href="http://K7Waterfront.org/Topic/Parks"><img src="http://K7Waterfront.org/Images/ParksMap.jpg" class="floatright image1px"></a>
<ul>
<li> See our [waterfront parks][parks] page
<li> All have picnic tables and benches
<li> Kingston's parks maintenance is spotty.  Most are clean and fine, but a few suffer from neglect.  On balance the waterfront parks are better maintained than the rest.
<li> See our [beaches][beaches] topic, though don't be surprised to find a beach is posted.

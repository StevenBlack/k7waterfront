TOKEN PARK CONCEPT PLANS</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  have <em>finally</em> been posted on the City website.

<p><strong>Observation:</strong> You've got to love how this city does business.</p>
<ul>
<li>It plans a public meeting with no documents posted online beforehand.
<li>At the meeting, attendees must queue to have a brief chance to look at diagrams.
<li>Then attendees must sit-through the orchestrated sales-pitch.
</ul>

<p>By not posting plans before the meeting, this assures an unprepared and uninformed audience at the meeting, all the better minimize the chance of derailing pre-conceived development plans.

<p><strong>This is really how our waterfront got so ruined</strong>: one step at a time.  That's how Block-D got stuffed with tall buildings, and that's how the rest of us ended-up with a token-park.

<p><strong>Here we have a "proposed marina building"</strong> with no connection whatsoever to the marina.  The foot of the nearest dock, on the west-side of the Radisson Hotel, is 245 m away.  The foot of the main docks, on Clarence Street, is over 520m away.  That's going to be a great marina building, don't you think?

<p><strong>Here is detail of the juncture between Token Park and the stone breakwater</strong> that surrounds Confederation Marina.  <strong>Note the utter lack of vision</strong>: there's plenty of usable space on the stone breakwater.  Waterfront cities world-wide that "get it" have piers and breakwalls people can walk on.  But in Kingston?  Nah!  Token Park is really a dog park, a place where the condo owner's pets can "go", nevermind that there's acres of great waterfront space out on the stone breakwall.

**Able Sail Kingston** (ASK) is a not-for-profit organization that provides recreational sailing programs to Kingston's community of disabled persons.

**ASK offers two learn to sail programs:**

* The Youth program offers complete integration with the [KYC Junior Sailing program](http://kingstonyachtclub.com/lts/js.cfm). The sessions mirror the Junior Sailing 2 week session but are flexible to meet the needs of the sailor.
* The Adult program provides supervised or instructional courses offered starting each June 5th. Course times are flexible and can be personalized to fit your schedule.

Able Sail Kingston uses a fleet of [Martin 16](http://www.accessdinghy.org/equipment/boats/303wide.htm](Access 303) and [http://martin16.com/) sailboats.

See, for example, [Martin 16 CORK results](http://kingstonyachtclub.com/ablesail/cork2006/index.cfm](Able Sail at CORK 2006) including [http://cork.org/results2006/M16.HTM).

In summer 2006 Able Sail Kingston had a dozen adult sailors in the program, several of whom came out a weekly basis. [http://cork.org/results2006/M16.HTM) and [Coupe du Quebec)(http://www.martin16class.org/events/coupequebec.php](Audrey Kobayashi]()http://www.ontariosailing.ca/Programs/Accessible_Sailing/Audrey_Kobayashi.php), program director, is the Ontario Champion for disabled sailing, winning every regatta she entered, including [CORK). Several other sailors competed for the first time this year and placed very well.

The program is open to anyone with a disability. We have sailors whose disability ranges from spinal injuries, to MS. It is committed to getting anyone into the boats, no matter their disability.

**ASK boats can be steered**

* manually,
* with an electronic joystick used for sheering,
* with a windlass system to operate the main and jib sheets,
* and a sip and puff system for those who have disabilities which limit their mobility.


Able Sail Kingston also [trains its volunteers](http://www.sailing.ca/news/headline.asp?numNewsID=1169).

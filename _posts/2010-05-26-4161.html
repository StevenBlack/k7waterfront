<p><strong>SWIM AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong> because there's no beach report avaiable from our <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/HealthUnitNewsArchive" target="_blank">lard-ass
Health Unit</a>.

<p>It's only 31 degrees outside today.  This has been forecast for quite some time.

<p>There's been <strong>no signal</strong> that the KFLA Health Unit will be making-up the <strong>miles they are behind Toronto</strong> in beach report timeliness and data quality.

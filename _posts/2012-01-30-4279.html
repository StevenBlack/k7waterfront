<p>The latest <a href="http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/greatlakes/hh/datalinks/PrinterFriendly/DailyLevelsEnglish.pdf" title="Link to the US Army Corps of Engineers report on Great Lakes water levels." target="_blank">
LAKE ONTARIO WATER LEVEL FORECAST</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  predicts higher than normal water levels into the summer.</p>

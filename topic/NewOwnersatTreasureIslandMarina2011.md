The new owners (Dean & Alison Taylor) at Treasure Island Marina are very excited about their transition from Toronto to Kingston. Dean & Alison officaly took posseion of the Marina January 3rd 2011.

" So far we have had a very friendly reception from our boaters, local residents and local business people"

The restaurant is scheduled to open late spring with a new menu and a new attitude. Reservations can be made by ship to shore radio on channel 68. If transient docks are full a shuttle boat will be happy to pick you up in the harbour.

The Marina will move to a full service including mechanical technican for boat repairs. A new 25 ton travel lift is on the way for the Fall haul out with other services being offered including reasonable shrink wrap and storage facilities.

Be sure to stop by and welcome the Taylors to the neighbourhood and while your there enjoy some good food and great views.

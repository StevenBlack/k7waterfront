<p><a href="http://cork.org/newsitems/nov_13.html" target="_blank">A NEW FORMAT FOR
CORK</a>  is announced today.
<p><a href="http://cork.org/newsitems/nov_13.html" target="_blank">According to the
press release</a>, <strong>CORK 2009 will play-out ike this</strong>:
<ul style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">
<li>August 19 - 22: <strong>CORK International Event</strong> for Youth and Development dinghy classes.
<li>August 23 - 27: <strong>CORK Olympic Classes Event</strong> for high-performance competition in Olympic and invited "development" dinghy classes.
<li>August 28 - 30: <strong>Offshore and One Design Keelboat and Dinghy Classes</strong> for Offshore (PHRF) classes, one design Keelboats, Able Sail, and international dinghy classes.
</ul>

<p style="margin-top:0.5em;"><strong>This is great news</strong> on a number of levels.

<p>For example, for the first time in many years, there is <strong>no overlap between CORK events and the obnoxious <a href="http://www.pokerrunsamerica.com/homepage/Tour%202009.html" target="_blank">1000
Islands Kingston Poker Run</a> </strong>, currently scheduled for August 7-8 2009.

<p><strong>Another plus</strong>: better segmenting the events means better cohesion amongst participants.  Youth and young sailors together; high-performance sailors together; and keelboat with international-class dinghies all together.  This makes planning the all-important social packages more straightforward.

<p><strong>Another plus</strong>: dates for the Keelboats and international-class dinghies -- generally older adult sailors -- dovetail with the <strong>2009 Kingston Blues Festival</strong>.

<p><p><strong>Another plus</strong>: CORK 2009 spans <strong>just 12-days of competition</strong>, compared to 18-days for CORK 2008.  This will be much easier on the volunteer-base, so better regattas for all-concerned are likely to result.

<p>Any downsides?  It's hard to quibble with any of this.

<p><strong>Also booked for 2009</strong> so far: <strong>cats!</strong>
<ul>
<li>July 17-19 - <strong>Hobie 16 Women and Youth North American Championship</strong>
<li>July 20-24 - <strong>Hobie 16 Open North American Championship</strong>
</ul>

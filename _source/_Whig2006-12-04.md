<b>Sewage system overflows at near-record high</b>
<b>By Jordan Press</b>

Heavy rain over the weekend caused the city's sewer system to spew a near-record amount of untreated waste water into local waterways.

About 45 million litres of sewage had to be bypassed from Kingston's antiquated sewer system after the city was hit with 50 millimetres of rain.

It was the second time in as many weeks that millions of litres of untreated waste water had to be bypassed after heavy rainfall. From Nov. 16 to Nov. 20, nearly 56.9 million litres of sewage was bypassed.

So far this year, Kingston has seen more bypass incidents than last year despite less rain.

About 130.5 million litres of sewage has been bypassed and 292.8 mm of rain has fallen. Last year, about 124.8 million litres was bypassed and 348.8 mm fell.

Those numbers are short of 2003 when 725.6 million litres was bypassed and 375.1 mm of rain fell on the city.

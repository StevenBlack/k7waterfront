<p>NEW <strong>.COM</strong> AND <strong>.CA</strong> WEB ADDRESSES FOR K7: <a href="http://k7waterfront.com/" class="noicon" target="_blank">K7Waterfront.com</a> and <a href="http://k7waterfront.ca/" class="noicon" target="_blank">K7Waterfront.ca</a>.

<p>Now you don't need to remember the <strong>.org</strong> part of the K7Waterfront web address because <strong>.com</strong> and <strong>.ca</strong> work too.

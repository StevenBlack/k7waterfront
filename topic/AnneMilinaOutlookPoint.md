**Anne Milina Outlook Point** is a small and rather new park at the end of the road that runs along the West side of Kingston Penitentiary.  It is named in honour of Anne Milina who, for many years, was a force for the preservation and beautification of the Portsmouth Village area of Kingston.

The park sits at the entrance of [Portsmouth Olympic Harbour][portsmoutholympicharbour].

The park was officially opened on June 15th 2008.

###History of Anne Milina Outlook Point
The park was developed by the Portsmouth Villagers Community Association. It has gone through two phases.

# Anne Milina, President of the Association through the 1990's, was instrumental in getting Corrections Canada to move their fence to the east near the lake to allow more space for the park. Some planting and benches were installed at that time.
# More recently PVCA has added more benches, picnic tables, a BBQ, extended the plantings and mounted a commemorative plaque in remembrance of Anne.

PVCA has been supported in part by Healthy Community grant money for which we applied which we supplemented with money from donations contributed by members of the Association.

##Boaters left on land after marina placed into receivership

Approximately 100 boats are land locked after the former Belle Harbour Marina was placed into receivership and the property gated off due to insurance concerns.

The property, formerly known as Morch Marine, had been owned by Belle Harbour Developments Inc. for the past few years but, on April 7, went into receivership with a court order naming BDO Dunwoody Ltd. as the receiver for the company. Signs were posted Friday informing visitors the yard where boats are stored during the winter has been closed.

Ken Pearl, vice-president of BDO Dunwoody, told The Intelligencer though the marina was operating the property had to be closed to the public.

"There was an operator of the marina who was expecting to operate, let's put it that way, but we could not enter into an agreement because there were insurance issues," Pearl said. He added the yard had to be closed to ensure "everyone is safe."

The yard may be reopened should the insurance issue be settled, Pearl added.

The move has left boat owners frustrated and curious.

Glenn Wylie, co-owner of the houseboat Pelican which has been taking fishermen out onto the Bay of Quinte for 30 years, said he was not informed of any of the events on the property.

"I haven't been told anything," he said. "All I know is I drove by the yard and its fenced and there's a sign saying it's closed."

Pearl said he had contacted as many boat owners as possible to inform them the property had gone into receivership and boaters were also being told they may not be able to rent slips at the marina this year.

Wylie, however, said he is not concerned about what happens at the property but wants to get his boat in the water. Even that, he said, may not happen despite a payment of approximately $1,000 being made last year to have the boat lifted out in the fall, stored for the winter and lifted back into the water this spring.

"We don't know what we're going to do," he said. "We're kind of between a rock and a hard place."

Another boater, who asked not to be identified, said many of the people who store their boats at the marina are frustrated and have no idea what is happening.

"Nobody seems to know anything," he said. "There's never been any notification given to the boaters, directly."

Pearl said an advertisement appeared in The Intelligencer last month informing boaters the property has gone into receivership and they could contact BDO Dunwoody.

He said though the company is in discussion with a local operator interested in running the marina this year, the company's main objective is to sell the property.

"The mandate of the receiver is to comply with the court order," Pearl said. "Our main mandate is to sell the property."

<img src="http://k7waterfront.org/Images/KYC_NewJSShed.jpg" class="floatright image1px" alt=""><p>There's a NEW ALL-PURPOSE JUNIOR SQUADRON SHED at <a href="http://KingstonYachtClub.com" target="_blank">Kingston Yacht Club</a>  close to being complete.  It will be used as a workshop for boat repairs on KYC's impressive dinghy fleet, sail storage, and can also serve as an activity room when the weather's poor.
<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews052006.html#3003" target="_blank">
Last year KYC renovated the boathouses</a>  on the East side of the property, along Simcoe Street.
<p>It's good to see visible signs of upgrades on the waterfront.

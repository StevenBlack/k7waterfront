PAN AM BID AIMS TO CONCENTRATE ON SUBURBS</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  in today's National Post.

<blockquote>
<p>Toronto is lending its name recognition to the $1.7-billion bid backed by the provincial and federal governments, but events will be staged across the Golden Horseshoe region, <strong>from St. Catharines to Hamilton, to Barrie to Oshawa</strong>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Which exactly matches what we've been hearing all along, and more recently from those in-the-know around the Toronto 2015 Pan American Games bid.

<p>So <strong>Kingston's definitely left on the outside, looking-in</strong>.

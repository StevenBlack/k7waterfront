##Collins Bay Yacht Club

We are small club of about 100 members, offering a variety of casual and organized activities for both sailors and power boaters. Our club is hosted by the privately owned [[Collins Bay Marina]]. Through their generous support, we are able to take advantage of the Marina's excellent facilities and dedicated staff to enhance membership benefits.

<h3>Cruising</h3>
For the cruising sailor, an excellent [[http://www.collinsbaymarina.com/CBYC/reciplist.html reciprocal program with 40 clubs]] throughout Lake Ontario and the Thousand Islands means a variety of economical destinations and options. Organized cruises throughout the sailing season are always memorable.

<h3>Racing</h3>
For those interested in racing, weeknight racing is held throughout the season, and features an expanded weekend racing schedule in conjunction with [[KingstonYachtClub|KYC]] and [[LoyalistCoveYachtClub|LCYC]].

In 2004, CBYC was honoured to host the Eastern Yachting Circuit (EYC) annual regatta from July 7-11.

<h3>Sailing School</h3>
Our CYA certified sailing school continued to grow in 2004, with an expanded fleet of Hunter 140's and the addition of new Club 420's for 2005 to offer a complete range of learning opportunities for children and adults.  For keelboat sailors, courses leading to [[http://www.sailing.ca/learnmore/education/ltc/BasicCruising.shtm CYA Basic]] or [[http://www.sailing.ca/learnmore/education/ltc/IntermediateCruising.shtm Intermediate Cruising Standard]] are also available. Safety seminars and demonstrations are integral to enhancing the boating experience for our members.

So, whether you're just interested in learning to sail, casual cruising through the Thousand Islands or around the Lake, club racing or weekend distance racing, barbecues and other social events, there's something for everyone.

##Calling all Marine Museum and Alexander Henry Friends
Plan to join us for **a taste of 'Icebreaker Ale' on Monday, 17 August 2009, beginning at 6 pm**, upstairs at the Kingston Brew Pub, 34 Clarence Street.

**The Kingston Brewing Company** has very generously agreed to brew a celebratory libation for the Alexander Henry's 50th, and it will be unveiled/untapped, or whatever one does to launch a beer, on the 17th. **Fifty cents from the purchase of each glass of Icebreaker Ale will be donated to the Marine Museum**.

Let's see how quickly we can sell out this celebratory brew! Brew Pub entrees run at $11-12 per person, plus beer of course, so plan to stay for a meal.

For those who prefer to keep with fine naval tradition (and aren't working during the day!), the actual launch of the brew will occur at 11 am on the 17th, also at the Brew Pub.

EDITORIAL</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  in the Whig last Saturday about how sinking millions into <strong>refurbishing the deep-water dock</strong> at the Marine Museum is a "no brainer".
<blockquote>
<p>This is a no-brainer, folks. A new pier would provide a tremendous boost to the city's tourism industry with little or no financial risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/__Whig20090103" target="_blank">Read the
whole thing</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.

<p>Now read the related <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/council/agenda/2008/A22_InfoRpt.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">
report by city staff to Council</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  Pay attention to <strong>the minuscule number of these vessels</strong> (one), the <strong>low number of expected stoppovers</strong> each year (under five), the <strong>small number of passengers aboard</strong> (which the Whig vastly overstates), and the <strong>actual time</strong> (a few hours) that ships are expected to be docked.

<blockquote>
<p>In real terms most cruise ships would start off by including Kingston as a port-of-call with a brief stay of several hours in port. This would offer the downtown merchants an opportunity to sell their wares and nearby and mid-distance attractions to be included in shore excursions.

page 8</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  of the report.)
</blockquote>

<p>Don't forget that these passengers arrive already sumptuously-fed with room-and-board aboard.  Also consider <strong>city staff's record of vastly overstating the economic benefits</strong> of all the downtown-centric projects they endorse.  Never a thumbs-down when it's downtown.

<p>Here's what's really happening: <strong>The Whig is the boardroom-bulletin publisher for the Downtown Kingston BIA</strong>.

<p>No subsidy for Downtown Kingston is ever panned, no matter how grotesque.  In The Whig, and among city staff, <strong>the BIA always trumps the interests of the rest of amalgamated Kingston</strong>.

<p>And City Council buys-in every time.  Foremost, in this case, is <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/council/councillors/sydenham.asp" title="Bill Glover" target="_blank">Councillor Bill Glover</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  who is all-in for a dock <em>uber alles</em>.  Then there's <a href="http://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/council/councillors/williamsville.asp" title="Ed Smith" target="_blank">Councillor Ed Smith</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  is a full-bird member of the <a href="http://www.downtownkingston.ca/dbia/committees.htm" target="_blank">BIA's
Executive Committee</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">.  In addition, we have <strong>three other City councillors</strong> (Councillors Hector, Hutchison, and Gerretsen) who are council-appointees to the <a href="http://www.downtownkingston.ca/dbia/board-of-directors.htm" target="_blank">BIA's
board of directors</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  and subject to systematic face-time and, therefore, pro-BIA sales pressure.

<p><strong>There's more:</strong>  None of this includes <a href="http://kingstontaxpayersassociation.ca/LeonoreFoster.htm" title="Council voting record for Foster" target="_blank">Councillor Foster</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  and <a href="http://kingstontaxpayersassociation.ca/HarveyRosen.htm" title="Council voting record for Rosen" target="_blank">Mayor Rosen</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">  who are certifiable Downtown Kingston BIA cronies.

<p><strong>That's how the systematic fleecing of the rest of amalgamated Kingston is engineered</strong>.  Nevermind the influence of a sycophantic Whig-Standard and the City's mostly downtown-based staff, <strong>Council is effectively an arm of the BIA, as opposed to the other way around</strong>.

<p><a href="http://kingstontaxpayersassociation.ca/LargeVenueEntertainmentCentre.htm" title="LVEC-related Council votes, for example" target="_blank">Maybe you thought
the last council was bad?</a> <img src="http://metalcraftmarine.com/offsitelnk.gif" border="0" alt="" class="resourcetype">

<p>Structurally, the current council is actually worse, and getting worse, because <strong>more potential fence-sitting councillors are co-opted into the BIA Board</strong> for systematic monthly face-time and indoctrination about the BIA's interests.

<p>Do we need a deep-water dock?  Absolutely.  We had one but, like most things around town, we never properly maintained it.  Should a deep-water dock today be our top infrastructure priority?  <strong>Should a deep-water dock be Kingston's top waterfront-related priority?</strong>

<p>If you had a few million dollars to spend on infrastructure, and assuming you wanted to spend it to improve Kingston's waterfront, would it go to help dock a ship with three-busloads-worth of tourists, three-times per year, for barely an afternoon each time?  Or should that money first go towards <strong>accessibility and recreation opportunities for the people who actually live here?</strong>

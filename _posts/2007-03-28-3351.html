<p><strong>TWO TAKEAWAYS FROM THE WIND PROJECT OPEN HOUSE</strong>:
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, for swimmers and windsurfers, it looks like they will be drilling at an angle from the shore outwards, and <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/PatersonPark-WolfeIslandWindProjectCable" target="_blank">
not trenching through the shoal at Paterson Park</a>.  That's good.

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/WolfeIslandWindProjectTowers" target="_blank">those
wind turbines are huge!</a>.  The rotors sweep a circle 93m in diameter, and the highest rotor point is 123m minimum,  which of course will be visible from some distance.

LEVELS ARE SERIOUSLY ABOVE NORMAL IN LAKE ONTARIO</a>.  About 17" above normal, in fact, which is huge.  Surprised?  Normally Lake Ontario is at its lowest right now.  But right now we're very close to last year's high water mark in August.

<p>Conversely the big lakes upstream -- Lakes Michigan, and Huron and Superior -- are still at way below average levels.

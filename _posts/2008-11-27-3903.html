LAFARGE LOSES APPEAL</a>, which clears the way for a Environmental Review Tribunal hearing on burning tires at its cement plant in Bath.

<p>So what does Lafarge plan to do?  Rather than <em>finally</em> facing serious environmental scrutiny, and stepping-up to  years of is own rhetoric, <strong>apparently Lafarge is scrapping its plans</strong>.

<p>How whacked is that?

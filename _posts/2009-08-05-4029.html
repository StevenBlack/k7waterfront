LAKE ONTARIO WATER LEVELS</a>  are currently above average, almost exactly where they were last year at this time.</p>

<p>The good news is <strong>the big-lakes upstream are replenishing</strong>.  You may recall that <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/KingstonWaterfrontNews022008.html#3704" title="Link to a K7Waterfront water-levels-related news item from 2007" target="_blank">
upper-lake levels were bleak back in 2007</a>.  Lake Superior was about 18" below average in August 2007 and Lakes Michigan and Lake Huron were about 23" below average in December 2007.

<p>
<strong>Lake Superior</strong> has been, for most of the summer, above last-year's levels, generally about 5 to 7" below its long-term average levels.  <strong>Lakes Michigan and Huron</strong> are a full 5 to 10" above last summer's levels, and currently within 6" of long-term averages.

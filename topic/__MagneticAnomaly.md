##Magnetic Anomaly in Kingston Harbour

With thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&newwindow=1&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=Newitt+site%3Anrcan.gc.ca+&btnG=Search">Larry R. Newett of Natural Resources Canada</a>.

From The Canadian Surveyor, Vol. 34, No. 4. December 1980.

Note: two lobes, the Western one (SE of POH) with a declination of 14 degrees East, and the Eastern lobe (S of KYC) with a declination of 14 degrees West.

One way to picture this is to imagine
an underground deposit of magnetite
that runs deeper towards the East.

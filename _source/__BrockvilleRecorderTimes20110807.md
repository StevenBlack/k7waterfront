##Thousand Islands Poker Run delights the masses once againBy Steve Pettibone


The sounds of booming engines and the brilliant rainbow of colours of a wide array of powerful boats once again delighted the ears and eyes of thousands of spectators at Blockhouse Island on Saturday when the annual Thousand Islands Poker Run hit Brockville's shores.

Organizers estimate more than 60 boats took part in this year's event, which left from Kingston Saturday morning and made its traditional lunch-time pit stop at Tunnel Bay. The boats docked in Brockville for lunch before heading to Prescott to pick up another card, prior to returning for Kingston.

The event thrilled a huge mass of spectators, who lined the south shore of Blockhouse Island to watch the potent watercraft line up and leave in two mass groups from Brockville at approximately 2 p.m.

"These boats are spectacular," said Brett Doll of Cornwall. "This is really impressive."

Doll rode his bicycle to Brockville this week to spend some time with a friend who lives in town and had recommended he come to Ribfest. Having spent last night at Hardy Park taking in all the culinary delights, music and ambience of Ribfest, he said the Poker Run was another great experience.

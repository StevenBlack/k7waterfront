IDIOTIC BEACH REPORT</a>  from the <strong>KFLA Public Health Unit</strong>.

<p>Go ahead, <a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/ShowNews.aspx?NewsId=185" title="Seriously, you won't believe this press release." target="_blank">read
it</a>.

<p>Who writes this crap?  Who is it written-for?  Er, which beaches are open, or closed, or what?  This is bullshit.

<p>Hey, KFLA Public Health unit, <strong>give us obvious in-context links</strong> to the <a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/News.aspx?Report=Beach" title="But this is a bare-bones list, with no actual data disclosed." target="_blank">
complete list of beaches in the KFLA area posted as unsafe for
swimmers</a>.

<p>Just like that.

<p>Not long confusing link-free paragraphs then, far from there, a link that doesn't-look-like-a-link, out-of-context, which few people will scroll-to and find, and fewer will click.  Can you find it?  <a href="http://www.kflapublichealth.ca/ShowNews.aspx?NewsId=185" title="There's a link in there, way at the bottom. Did you see it the first time? See it now? Scroll way down..." target="_blank">
Look again</a>.

<p>Seriously, how hard could that be?  This is so basic.

<p>This isn't news. For too long the KFLA Public Health Unit has been <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/HealthUnitNewsArchive" title="Our Heath Unit has been feeding us information-free, data-free, self-serving beach-crap for too long. Click to see more." target="_blank">
an embarassment to our waterfront</a>.

<p>Dr Ian Gemill, <strong>enough self-serving verbiage about beaches</strong>.  Do us a favour: <strong>either clean-house or retire</strong>.

A quantity of oil from one of the 32 train cars that derailed near the Via Rail station on Monday has leaked into Little Cataraqui Creek, the Ministry of the Environment has confirmed.

For the first few days after the crash, the ministry had no evidence that the oil had made it into the creek. But on Wednesday, steady rain melted the snow
and ice around the waterway and washed some of the spilled oil downstream to the culvert at John Counter Boulevard, where it continues to be detected in the
creek water.

Michel Finn, spokesman for the ministry office in Kingston, said the oil was detected in the culvert Wednesday night after rain washed it past the booms that had been set up along the creek’s edge to contain the spill.

“Additional vacuum trucks are on site, more booms are being deployed, but there is an amount that’s going beyond the boomed area,” he said. “Now because of the
spring weather, we’ve started to see some oil beyond the booms and crews are doing their best to capture the oil before it goes downstream.”

So far, there is no indication that the oil has continued down the creek past the culvert, said Finn.

Many of the clean-up workers have been at the site just off John Counter Boulevard since shortly after the crash at 5:50 a.m. on Monday.</p>

Thirty-two of 142 cars on a freight train slid off the rails, causing many to spill contents such as wheat, soya, molasses, scrap paper, plywood, petroleum coke and Magiesol 52 cutting oil.

No one was injured, but the crash stopped rail travel along the Toronto-Montreal-Ottawa corridor, delaying as many as 3,000 passengers who had to be placed on buses.

The cause of the crash remains unknown. Canada’s Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

Yesterday, surface water experts and other ministry staff remained on site to monitor the environmental impact and continue to take water samples from the creek farther downstream at Princess Street near the Ambassador Hotel.

“There’s lots of flow at the Princess Street culvert, but there is no evidence of oil at that point,” Finn said.

He said the hope is that there will be little environmental impact at the site after the cleanup.

On Tuesday, the ministry reported that 9,100 litres of oil had leaked at the site, but yesterday Finn said government officials don’t yet know how much oil has washed into the creek.

Several contractors, including Drain-All and Scott Environmental, were at the site yesterday to suction out the oil that was being collected by the booms and special oil absorbent at the culvert on John Counter Boulevard.

The sheen of the oil, thin and clear, could be seen on the surface of the creek at the culvert on John Counter Boulevard yesterday.

Canadian National has several dozen workers at the site to continue clearing away the crumpled rail cars, emptying them of their contents, cutting them up and removing the scrap metal by truck from the site.

CN crews have been working 24 hours a day since Monday.

The work crew has been hauling the rail cars away from the tracks to the yard of Edwards Ford Collision Centre on John Counter Boulevard, where they are emptied of their contents and cut into pieces by a large hoe.

Yesterday, there were four cars left to cut up on the site.

“Everything should be cleared by sometime this weekend,” said CN spokeswoman Julie Senecal.

All week, crews have been removing the material from the crashed cars and recycling as much of it as possible, she said.

“We try to bring the site to the same level as it was before and part of that is adhering to all environmental laws and recycling as much of the goods as crews are able,” she said.

A quantity of wheat was given to local farmers free of charge, said Senecal.

But one local business has suffered economical impacts because of Monday’s crash, which occurred immediately behind Edwards Ford Collision Centre.

Rob Shaw, manager of the body shop, said it’s difficult to estimate how much revenue the business lost this week.

“We were shut down for the first two days,” he said. “It was Wednesday afternoon when they actually let customers come in.”

The property has been dominated by heavy equipment and damaged rail cars since Monday.

“By the end of the weekend, they’re expecting that not only will the old rail cars be gone, but they’ll have the property graded with new gravel,” said Shaw.

“That seems optimistic to me, but they’re certainly moving along quite quickly.”

He hopes to recoup some of the lost revenue from CN.

“CN has certainly been very helpful and they’ve been telling us right from the beginning that they’ll be looking after any expenses incurred by us in relation to this tragedy,” he said. “They’re going to fix up the property because it’s just a construction zone right now. The paved parking lot is pretty much ruined right now … it’s all just soupy mud.”

Environmental monitoring may continue at Little Cataraqui Creek for many months as experts keep close watch to make sure the oil hasn’t contaminated the
waterway.

CN, the ministry and the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority, which helps protect the waterway, will work together to monitor the aftermath.

<p>On August 1st, Lake Ontario Waterkeeper published a <a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/content/swim/three_area_beaches_closed.php" target="_blank">
short piece</a>  about three local beaches that are presently closed because of <i>E.coli</i>.
<p>Meanwhile, at <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/RichardsonBeach" target="_blank">Richardson
Beach</a>, which wasn't closed, on the hottest, muggiest, and smoggiest August 1st in Kingston history, there were very few swimmers, doubtless due to the general confusion over which <a href="http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/Beaches" target="_blank">beaches</a>  were, or wern't, safe.

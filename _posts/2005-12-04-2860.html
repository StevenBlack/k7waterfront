<p>CKWS-TV <a href="http://www.ckwstv.com/news/news_xml.cfm?cat=1&amp;rss=1&amp;rem=25170&amp;red=80110923aPBIny&amp;gi=1&amp;gm=news_local.cfm" target="_blank">
reported Friday</a>  that a 72-foot cruise ship, the <a href="http://www.heritagecruises.com/" target="_blank">"Georgian Clipper"</a>, will begin serving the port of Kingston in the spring.  See their <a href="http://www.heritagecruises.com/itinerary_2006.html" target="_blank">2006
itinerary</a>, and see more pictures and diagrams of the vessel <a href="http://www.escortedfallfoliagetours.com/greatlakes/Georgianclipper.html" target="_blank">
here</a>.
<p>This ship only carries 18 passengers.   The story notes that, apparently, Kingston lacks the deep water docking to accommodate this sort of business on a larger scale. It's pretty clear that Kinston is underachieving in a spectacular way when it comes to accommodating larger vessels, cruise vessels included.

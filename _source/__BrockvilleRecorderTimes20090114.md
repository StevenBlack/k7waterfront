##Dive shop seeks city's help finding new locationBy Michael Jiggins
Janyary 14 2009

<div class="column2">

The owner of Brockville's only dive shop appealed to a city council committee Tuesday to work with her in finding a new home for her business.

Otherwise, Dive Brockville Adventure Centre's Helen Cooper said the city risks scuttling a vital component of its economic future.

Cooper told council's economic planning and development committee yesterday she is close to finalizing a deal to sell her dive shop property on Water Street.

Owners of the Wedgewood Retirement Resort are seeking to buy Cooper's property to expand their operation, she told the committee.

At the same time, she said she has been approached by economic development officials in Kingston about relocating to that city.

"What would be sad is if I did sell to the Wedgewood and my shop went out of town," she told committee members councillors Mike Kalivas, Gord Beach and Jeff Earle.

"How can we work together to work something else?" asked Cooper, who said it's possible she could remain at her present location for up to a year.

Following a 20-minute discussion between Cooper, staff and members of council, Kalivas said he heard "loud and clear" that the city is willing to explore options.

The committee took no action on the request, other than to assure her they're open to listening to her ideas.

Cooper stressed her appearance at the committee Tuesday was "not just about my store - it's about let's accommodate the diving."

She said the city and its residents must change their attitude about divers who visit the community from around the world.

"The general Brockville idea is that divers get in the way," said Cooper, adding she's heard their presence along the waterfront described as "an annoyance" or "irritating."

###Dive shop being courted by Kingston, owner says

The problem, she said, is residents only recognize divers when they're suited up going into or coming out of the water.

They're not recognized when dining in local restaurants, checking into hotels or shopping in stores.

"What people don't see is the money that they spend and bring into the local economy," stressed Cooper.

It was a point seized on by Councillor Henry Noble.

A member of the city's tourism advisory committee - which urged Cooper to approach the city - Noble said the issue she raised has become a "huge concern" for the tourism group.

"We have places down the river looking to build accommodations to pull this business away from us," he warned.

With a local group pursuing a plan to sink a warship in the St. Lawrence River a few kilometres west of Brockville, he said now is not the time for the city to alienate divers or leave them without a shop.

Proponents of the artificial reef project have said it will attract 6,000 divers annually and generate $8 million in economic activity.

"If we don't have a dive shop, we don't have the diving," said Noble.

Danny Krupa, a local diver who attended yesterday's meeting, said there's no question divers would leave Brockville off the map if Cooper's business pulls up anchor.

Cooper pitched one possible arrangement to the committee.

She asked if the city would approve a seasonal operation on public land that would utilize a large shipping container to house her air tank refilling station.

The container would be painted in an underwater motif to resemble her current shop, while the rest of her business would operate from a couple of out-buildings located within a fenced-in area.

Beach told Cooper he was "surprised" she wasn't looking for a permanent location.

She said she explored Water Street for an alternative location, but didn't find anything suitable that was available.

While there were locations along King Street, she said they lacked enough nearby parking for divers bringing tanks for refilling.

Earle, meanwhile, proposed looking into the use of the lower portion of the city-owned pavilion in St. Lawrence Park or housing the business in the former Phillips Cables pumphouse on the waterfront near the park.

The city recently purchased that parcel of land.

An ongoing waterfront study and the official plan review - which will both examine future land use on the waterfront - could complicate the process of finding an alternate location, noted Earle.

Meanwhile, acting parks and recreation director Valerie Harvey expressed some concern with the St. Lawrence Park proposal, noting parking is already a problem there.

<blockquote><b> Pigeon Island </b>is located about 15 km south of Kingston in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario. According to the International Birding Association (IBA) it is "flat, about 5 ha in size, dominated by limestone bedrock, and has a thin covering of soil and guano that supports grass and herbaceous plant communities. The only woody vegetation is a clump of dead lilac bushes near the centre of the island".
<p> Today, a 65 foot tall metal tower supports an automatic light. From 1871 to 1909, a permanent lighthouse keeper manned the island.
<p> Pigeon Island supports a mixed-species colony of about 6,200 bird pairs of five species. It is an Ontario provincial bird sanctuary.<br></blockquote>
